Each time someone is eliminated Barkley should throw them out a window.

"Don't tell anyone but I think I'm ahead of the pack here. I see how LeBron looks at me. Especially when I threw that lob. LeBron smiled at me and told me that was a good lob."
"LeBron wants me on his team more than any of those other guards. I'm getting a mini basketball this week. I'm the future Mr. Cavalier."
*Somewhere, in a house in Lakewood, in a dark room illuminated only by a small television, Austin Carr chokes on mouthful of popcorn.*
Is lakewood the nice part of Cleveland?All the lakewood places I know are shitty. Florida and Georgia. Maybe Cleveland really is opposite town.
Lakewood is like, a third hipster white kid... a third gay... a sixth Palestinian, and a sixth everyone else. A decent affordable suburb.
"Ay yo I was worried until I saw that shitty ass lob from that other dude. LeBrun could barely hold back from laughing at that scrub. But for real tho, I got this shit. I'm comin' for that Mozgov money."
Imagine Lance Stevenson in the confession room explaining why he blew in LeBron's ear. "I knew he would need me one day...we would need each other so I had to do something memorable"
Rondo: "Man these other PGs are a bunch of babies. My vets would never go to the cameras to complain about other players."

"No I'm taking my talents to South Beach"
alright, now that's just ridiculous.  Nobody is dumb enough to have a special called The Decision.
Or "The LeCision "
I want Lance. I think he's definitely the best out of the group, and he'd be the best reality star out of the bunch. Rio would make a good Jerry from Parks and Rec tho
You mean Gary, right?
That is LIT'RALLY the funniest thing I've heard all day.
Ann Perkins
Richard Jefferson is Chris Traeger
üëâüèªüëâüèªAnn Perkins!!
No, it's Larry.
Regardless, can we talk about his wife and daughters tho üëåüèæ
That man has the biggest penis I have ever seen
You mean Terry?
Wouldn't Lance be the Chad of the show?
100% the Chad. He's funny from the outside but scary when you really think about it. Mario is Daniel where you think he sucks but then you realize that he is actually awesome and should be the star of the show
I haven't seen Lance play in awhile, so can somebody who has tell me if he still looks good? I feel like a lot of people's opinions of him are based off a really good first half he had 4 seasons ago.
At this point Tyronn Lue should just make himself the backup point guard
*gets stepped over the first game*
By Lebron
My bad "coach"
[deleted]
by god its david blatt!
If they're bring out Kirk Hinrich, yeah.
I'm here for this
[deleted]
Lance lance will make em dance
I would root for Captain Kirk so hard. Imagine if you will...Kirk wins the show. He's on the floor during Game 7 of the NBA Finals. The Cavs are down 1 with 30 seconds left against Golden State.LeBron brings the ball up the court. Passes to Kyrie. Kyrie tries to dribble through Klay Thompson and puts up a shot. It misses. Tristan Thompson gets the rebound. Kirk is in the corner open from 3. Tristan Thompson passes Kirk Hinrich the ball.Kirk Hinrich punts the ball into the stands, flips LeBron the double-bird and yells "BULLS FOR LIFE BITCH" as he walks off the court. The Bulls retire his jersey number and he never has to pay for a drink in Chicago again. Go Bulls.
You forgot to put his speech "Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, Lebron was the most human"- Captain Kirk
Ok now I really want this to happen. I promise I'll dress like Captain Kirk (As a Bull, obviously, with goggles and sleeve, all that jazz) for a year, even at work, if he does that.
It should be more like the Apprentice IMO:* Everybody lives together. * Give each player a set of teammates and ask them how they plan on running the offense.* Ask both teams to play pickup against each other. First team to 11 points wins.* Each player is mentored by an advisor on the Cavs (not LeBron)
Does this mean that Lebron will be the President in 12 years?
If so, would he ban international players?
He'd build a wall around the 3 point line
It's not to keep everyone from shooting threes. The "good ones" can shoot as many as they want. The problem, folks, is that you get these bad shooters. They come from everywhere. They're bringing Josh Smith, they're bringing Corey Brewer. We're better off without these guys shooting threes, okay? I know it. You know it. Everyone knows it.
And he is gonna make GSW pay for it.
Just to keep out unmarked 3pt shooters. No ones saying anything about well defended (possibly off balance) 3 pt shots. Lebron has always liked those
I'd take it at this rate
I prefer this.
I would kill to watch this.
&gt;I'm sure him and his posseHow dare you **HOW DARE YOU**
I'd watch it.
Would be kind of like Making the Cut which was a fantastic show.
Was the the show about Texas Tech?
I think that was called knight school or something.
Final test for contestants will be [doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxjHEepOFKU)Have Lebron and Barkley as the judges, both sitting in the shadow with their outlines making it blatantly obvious it's them. Barkley will disagree every time and Lebron will call him fat.
But that's just inside the NBA but replacing Shaq with LBJ
did dat dude jus eat horseshit?
indubitably
C'mon man why post this
Click it while eating.Saw the title. Thought "no way..."Looks like I am done eating.Thanks, OP.
Bleh!
The Cleveland Cavaliers have decided to take its talents to.... **more after the break**
There should be at least one contestant who is way too old but they keep him around because of his touching life story. I suggest Eric Snow.
I think Baron Davis has this spot covered.
Is his hair line still receding?
Steve Francis
Hey, Steve Francis is younger than Vince Carter and Andre Miller.

We are *all* witnesses
And the regular season has officially become the offseason. Dammit KD.
NBA on TNT's ig just took your idea: https://www.instagram.com/p/BP_EvRQhtQH/?taken-by=nbaontnt&amp;hl=en
At least they gave credit
3 judges just like American Idol. Lue is the Paula Abdul, always being kind and hyping them up. Griffin is the Randy Jackson, he's gonna keep it real with you but be gentle about it. The New Sheriff in Town is obviously Simon Cowell. Lebron just ripping into these vets like "Nate Rob, your little ass wasn't even invited, did you sneak in inside 'Rio's backpack or something? You've been outta the league for a reason, you should be getting posted up by six-footers in China not playing for a championship." I'd watch
Is Lue gonna be on pills and wine too? Awesome.
you made it https://twitter.com/NBAonTNT/status/826917789613092864
holy shittttttt
nah, NBA on TNT just stole your idea off reddit. Go get your dues!
They could also call it "My Super Sweet 16"16 year old drama queen trapped in the body of a 32 year old who is never satisfied with what she have and keeps whining to their parents for new toys. This year, 16 playmakers will compete for a roster spot to appease LeQueen
&gt; him and his posseHey man that's over the line.
I wonder who the hoe of the group is? Lance?
they should get a street ball player. They just want someone to dribble around and pass right? who cares if they can shoot or not . its not like the NBA enforces carrying
I just wanna see Chalmers and Hinrich get drunk in a jacuzzi and do weird shit... lol joking haha
The guys who made the Game of Zones should do this.
Making the Land
Corine's such a bitch tho
She clearly doesn't have the emotional intelligence that Nick is looking for
Did you just call her stupid? Did you just emotionally attack her?
yo i agree but she was so funny last episode
Dude, all the great Americans took naps. MJ took naps.
Where does Nate Robinson come in
Ah I can see it now, final episode would be called: *The Decision*
I would watch any competition involving Mario Chalmers going head to head with Lance Stephenson
And also Lebron marries the winner
Nah MAKING THE BAND and LEBRON is PUFFY.
Making the Land
Coming up on tonight's episode of Making the Land, LeBron sends the candidates out to the Bronx to get breast milk from a Cambodian immigrant.
This is hilarious. In between drills they should do cut scenes where each star hangs out with Lebron 1:1 courtside.
Instead of handing them roses or something, the guys who make it through to the next round of cuts should be handed Eastern Conference Championship rings.
Team Rio baby.
Lmao the rare January 'dog-days' shit post, I love it
But it's February bro
I love this sub
Whoa whoa watch the P word
this is one of the funniest threads ive ever seen
This is why r/nba is the best sub on reddit
I like it.
This sounds cool but we should have Jim Grey be the host and do all the interviews. ESPN could air the special and any of the ad revenue could go to the Boys &amp; Girls club. This would be an awesome way to monetize such a decision while raising funds for kids in need. Let's make it happen /r/NBA!!!
Yeah, cause the world needs *more* reality tv.
encouraging more reality tv?  thats a down vote.
You know when society has no more hope when something like this becomes reality, lol
Would be a good spinoff from lebrons "The Decision"
Does lebron go on air to announce his decision
Lebrons posse Lmfao
Have LeDad James sign the winner's adoption papers like at the end of Like Mike...
Being a Lebron teammate is like joining the Kardashians, suddenly you cant do anything unless you are getting paid for it, pretty soon they will hire players to play for them while they ride the pine.
Dan LeBetard had a bit about this on his rant when Bron came to the Heat. He called it RUN THE POINT NIGHT!
Dwyane Wade comes in with a mustache and call himself Dane Hade
I'd watch it. LeBron has his own production company so we're halfway there already.
Is it the offseason already?
If they need a center, they could call that one "The Wall"
Who'd be the surprise replacement contestant if one of them got injured?
http://i.imgur.com/vSraXrG.png
You do realize there is a daily shitpost thread right?
For each round Lebron can hand them a baby goat if they move on since the winner will inevitably be the cavs/LeBron's  next scapegoat.
I was a student at Texas Tech when Bob Knight did this exact thing. Was very interesting.
The Wall is like an OD version of Plinko from The Price Is Right
Tbh, I'd  rather see them hand out roses
I'd.....watch it probably
Lol I legit would watch this
And the winner joins Scotus.
LeBron drives to the rim, and kicks out a small basketball to Chalmers, signalling his acceptance into the next round
U have to trust The Process
Let me just lay this idea out there. The final round involves the finalists writing and directing an actual musical/play. It doesn't need to be basketball related. It just needs to be better than "Cats".
So.. the Cavs version of 4th and Long
Team Robinson all the way!
Should cut Anderson, sign Ben Gordan and Hasheem Thabeet, although I'm biased
I haven't kept up with the cavs in a while. Is Kyrie not a playmaker now?
He can't play 48 minutes a game
So? Cleveland has enough talent. I'm sick of this team trying to hoard every good player.If a team consisting of Lebron, Kyrie, Korver, Love, and Smith can't get it done then it's a coaching issue.
I like how you include Korver like he is still a star. He is 35 years old and hasn't averaged double digits in several years.
He was an All star like two years ago.
So were Kobe and Dirk, are they still great players this season?
Kobe is obviously retired but Dirk isn't awful if that's what you're trying to get me to say. He's still averaging double digits unless the sites I checked are lying then by all means prove me wrong. Also legacy &gt; current stats of an aging veteran. Kobe and Dirk will be in the hall of fame.
Why would his retirement matter, he was an All Star two seasons ago, therefore by your logic, he must still be a good player.And why the hell are you bringing legacy into the conversation?? Does legacy have any impact on how good a player is at the current moment? If so, I guess you would have to admit that the Cavs would be better off right now with Paul Pierce than with Kyrie Irving, since legacy is apparently all that matters.
I would watch the fuck out of this.
And then at the end of the show pick none of them. Bring in Seth Curry to guard Steph in the Finals. Let em kill each other. It would be the most cost effective way to deal with Steph in the finals.
man, you save shit posts like this for the off season
This is a T1 All-Star Weekend shitpost
Playmakers...Great show by ESPN. Killed after 1 season.
Reddit.com/Showerthoughts
He should be handing out green lights
LeBron already runs a ridiculous reality show called the NBA.
Handing out little sculptures of broken knees and the tears of unrealised potential.Or just regular red roses like on the bachelor. See, I provide options with my bad jokes.
I don't get it. Can someone explain to me why the cavs need a PG and why this is funny. I just watch basketball and hope they win.
Is it out of line for /u/apf429 to say the word "posse"?Stephen A, your thoughts.
/r/showerthoughts
or lebron could stop being a lil bitch
wow why is shit post on the front page
Hosted by Michael Irvin!
Have Allen Iverson come on as a surprise guest midway thru the season and let him end up winning it.
Great post made me laugh
This could be a way I get my fianc√© to enjoy basketball.
/r/ShowerThoughts
This is also how LeBron should have done The Decision.
Nah, "Making The Team"LeBron: " First thing imma need y'all to do is go down to Dayton and get me some rogaine..y'all do that for me, I'll open the gym"
"my name is lance, im a former nba player looking to get back on my feet, man its been rough for a while. i know me and lebron dont have a great history together but im willing to put that aside if he and this organization gives me a chance, i know i still got something to prove. "
Someone on here is a TNT spy... Just saw a pic of this idea on IG!
Dude they heard you https://instagram.com/p/BP_EvRQhtQH/
How about simply "The Backup"?
You stole this from all the great jokes people were making on twitter yesterday, right?

It's cool man they were comparing it more to Making the Band and they were way funnier.
Screw it i'm on team Delly!
woah don't say posse

"The Bachelor", Playmaker Edition
if they sign lance stephenson they just need to do a trade and get iggy from the warriors, then they wil have all the lebron stoppers on the cavs..
I'm team lance 100% of the way
It's like that movie, "The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh"
I love that your idea has taken off as it has. I'm relatively new to the NBA, but this post is like a soulmate. I love the mini-basketballs. Maybe the lines on the mini-basketballs can be jagged to look like a mini-basketball rose!!! The stem can be 'Brons arm.
All the proceeds would be donated to the Boys &amp; Girls club
Can we give them a Rose? *jk i actually just want my team to get healthy again*
The only way to compete with 2 league MVP's, is with 2 league MVP's
Fucking hell don't give them Rose. You know what will happen, don't you? He'll return to his MVP ways. I don't want to him to play like his MVP days ON THE CAVS.
I would not watch that, respectfully.
Team rio
tbh I'm already F5ing pretty hard to see the latest. NBA has to be the best soap opera on man
TBH I'd pay 100 bucks for that
Ty Lawson, you know he will throw a drink at someone
It's possible this might be the result of a fever dream messing with me, but wasn't there a show like this where players competed for a spot on one of the D-League teams?
Didn't the cowboys do this to find a WR
I would pay top dollar to watch this
[Hosted by Michael Irvin, please for the love of god.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLxxIR2M5dc)  He needs to host every sports-themed reality show until the end of time.
I want Allen Iverson on this show NOW!I know he wouldn't have a realistic shot but would be damn entertaining.
We need an NBA Meme network first.Then we bring back the "Scallenge"
Shit writes itself.
why aren't there any discussions about Norris Cole? he was pretty much a solid backup in Miami also during LeBron's Heat era
And they all have to live in a house together.  I'm team Baron Davis.
So we're letting Trump run the Cavs, too?
Wait I'm out of the loop. Cavaliers are looking for a new point guard? Are they a worse team than last year somehow or are they just freaking out becuase of the warriors?
Has Chalmers recovered from his injury and if so why has he not been picked up? The guy was the starting PG on 4 finals teams.
Baron Davis!!!
&gt;him and his posse#PHIL JACKSON IS THAT YOU?
/showerthoughts
Host: Delonte West
Get Michael Irvin to host it
What was the LeBatard quote back when he was rosterbating about the Big 3? Have a Run the Point contest. Every night, one lucky fan gets to play PG.
GIVE IT TO ME AGAIN!!!!
Probably be better than Lebrons current tv show
"his posse"... Did we not learn anything from the Phil Jackson debacle or is this a joke playing on that?
So hell's kitchen but with basketball?
Have Donald Trump host it

How about "Desperation"?
Master Clutch!!!
Team Stephenson let's go!
Lmao.
Lol! Actually yea
Dammit as soon as I read Barkley, I read the rest of the post in his doughnut eating voice.
LOLPlease don't do Kirk like that.  My heart couldn't take it.
And the winner gets to look forward to Lebron whining about how he  is still not good enough.
i'd watch the shit outta this.
Can we call this entire fiasco "Clevelands Decision‚Ñ¢"
Bump
XDDD
I been busy, is kyrie hurt or something
Michael Irvin had a reality show for an invite to the dallas cowboys training camp. The guy that won the show (Jesse Holley) actually made the 53 man roster, and [sealed the game up against the 49ers in overtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IakxHYVBk0) That was the game romo broke his ribs and punctured his lung.
What kind of point guard does the Cavs need? When they face off against San Antonio or the Rockets,  what kind of pacing will the new pg do?
Lmao at the posse line
They really should. I promise you there is Donohue playing at a y our pick up games that would be a good back up point guard.
From the people who brought you "The Decision"...
Wait? Did you just say "posse" when referring to LeBron and Co.? Phil Jackson tried that and it didn't work out too well for him...
The Cavs should invite some actual point guards to their point guard tryouts. I mean Hinrich, I guess.
Fuck the Cavs, jaborni!
Is anything on r/nba, actual basketball sports news anymore?
Reality shows suck. They should not do this.
It's not a serious idea...
Nothing would make me happier than Melo traded to the Cavs so he can finally sink that ship lol.  Either way Cavs already lost to GS in the finals.  It's a mental, and you can smell the fear.
Just like that "unbeatable" team in GS last year right? Right? How'd that work out for you? 3-1.
LMAO at least Curry didn't act like a female and complain publicly that he needed help.  Cavs won't win it again.  EVER.
Lebron should stop being a little bitch and just get shit done instead of crying for more players around him every couple months.
By the time the show finishes the Warriors have already swept them in the finals.
I'm telling you it's going to be yuuugeee
