*sigh* summer please end
Winter is coming
Summer is trash imo. You can always dress for the fall/winter, can't do that shit in the summer.
Bullshit! I hate the winter because it hurts me down to my bones, and I can never keep my legs warm enough no matter how cold it is. The summertime heat might be a little uncomfortable, but at least I feel like I can actually walk to my car or wherever instead of the mad dash I do in winter because it's so fuckin' cold. FUCK WINTER
I dunno man, you can always throw on more layers when it's cold. When it's hot as balls, and you're already in shorts and a tshirt/tank, what else can you do?
There's nothing to do but just become a giant pile of sweat at that point
Get butt ass naked bro
Done...now what?!
Look up forums discussing who is the real basketball G.O.A.T, whip out your mighty meat and have at it.
Learn to wear double hoodies with a parka. You'll be fine.I live in Atlanta... summer time makes me wish I could unzip my skin to cool down.
I don't think /r/nfl went through this
that's cause /r/nfl isn't filled with a bunch of fucking 14 year olds.
As an avid user of both, /r/nba is better, better humor, much more history. /r/nfl would give you the impression that the league has only existed for 15 years and their users are mostly painfully unfunny, and the mods take things a little too seriously. I see a lot more discussion here than I do in /r/nfl, which is mostly just reaction threads to the latest news, and that's year round, in season or not.
The mods are fucking cunts in r/nfl. Looking at you u/Yangar.
Boo fucking hoo.
I think you're pretty swell
Well thanks. I attempt to still be active in the sub, interact with users, etc. Can't win them all over no matter how nice or how strict I get apparently.
I know you're doing your best and that's all that matter to me, baby.
Yeah pretty much. hate that guy.
Aren't you a mod too?
Everyone who commented on this is a mod
Comment. Am I a mod now?
this is the truest thing I've ever seen
You're 100% correct.
Indisputable
I fully disagree with you* /r/nba is obsessed with drama, it's way more important than the actual games to an awfully high amount of users* abuse of advanced stats with little to no understanding of the cases which they are useful versus when they mislead* immaturity and acting like you're black; this sub is obsessed with co-opting black culture (fam, bruh...etc) and reliving cartoons of their youth (more dragonballs references than you can shake a stick at)* general low level conversations with "bro I was joking" type responses when someone takes them seriouslyI vastly prefer /r/nfl but I'm guessing there's a pretty clear delineation by age
Drama is a part of sports, don't tell me that /r/nfl doesn't eat that shit up, DeflateGate, Ray Rice elevator, Jerry Rice stickum, this business with Kaepernick and every goddamn fucking Manziel thread. I'm not saying that the Draymond Green-balls jokes haven't worn out their welcome, or that MozGod isn't tired to the extreme but.../r/nfl likes to pretend that its above trotting out the same 50-60 jokes, but go into any thread with a question about a team that has faced failure, adversity, going through the motions, terrible defense, terrible offense, bad coaches, bad FO, and just fucking watch the swarms of Browns, Lions, Jaguars, Titans fans descend like a tsunami looking for the same tired pity karma. I'm not saying it's untrue, but its like they find a personal joy in being able to say that they are or were the shittiest. ___________________As far as advanced stats go, you're right, but /r/nfl likes to treat PFF like its the holy grail. They have no idea what the algorithm is, or what most of the advanced stats listed truly mean as the game goes on, but they shovel it out all the same. /r/nba does this a lot too but they are easier to use and better for evaluating a player at first value. ____________________________I can't speak to the culture, though I'm sure that a lot of guys on here do fit in with that culture. I don't, I'm white. Closest I get is shooting the shit on 2k, that's about it.____________________________Low level conversations, you're not looking at /r/nfl enough if you don't see that 60% of the response to threads are low level memes, rehashed jokes and general references to previous team failures.
"old man yells at cloud" vibes
[deleted]
Maybe they've neutered /r/NFL but I've always thought the opposite. The roast threads have always been way better there than here imo, as well as the whose line is it anyways type of stuff
The /r/NFL roast threads were definitely better but I feel like the comments on /r/NBA are usually funnier.
Football is back fuck stop with this madness OP
How long till the preseason?
Down the rabbit hole we go... Off to google to find the answer.According to [this article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2436117/WNBA-star-Taurasi-gets-foul-kissing-opponent.html) and [this article](http://theurbandaily.com/2013/09/29/wnba-players-get-fouls-called-for-kissing-on-the-court/), it's happened in the WNBA between two opposing players, and both players were called for a foul. Here's [an article](http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2015/08/17/billboard-of-magic-johnson-and-isiah-thomas-kissing-appears-in-l-a-photo/) about Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas kissing on the court once. Looks like nothing was called, so it might actually be legal in the NBA.
&gt;Here's an article about Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas kissing on the court onceThat's the 80's though, everyone knows they never called fouls in the 80s
Back when the league was for real men
young bloods these days just don't know what its like to bang in the paint
Swiggity swooty here comes Chuck with dat booty

Are we not doing phrasing anymore?!
its fine if we arent just tell me
Call WAKA!
Where every game you break at least 1 leg, but have to be healed up for the next one.
And we were going uphill on offense AND defense
Is this where I say "We men"?
i mean, you can assume
you can assume

Back then you could get to third base before it was a foul. Now we have all of these ridiculous rules. It's horse shit if you ask me.
Back then the balls were egg shaped

You guys fuck in here! Nah you outside of jail that's gay as fuck lmao Edit: Gambino Reference
I miss those videos
I'm just trying to touch his dingdong!
&gt; Augustus is openly gay and has been a long time advocate for same sex sex marriage. &gt;On coming out Augustus said, 'Everyone thinks that the WNBA is one big lesbo party anyway,' she said in an interview with the Associated Press. 'So I think the coming out process isn't as tough for us because people already expect it.'
This is some of the weirdest slashfic I've ever read.

I was at a game once where Reggie Evans got a technical for a stopped-clock overly aggressive butt-pat on his former teammate Kyle Korver.It was especially awkward because then Korver was the one who had to go shoot the tech.
so apparently, reggie evans is known for butt slapping. heres a video of him getting ejected because he got into a butt slapping fight with grant hill. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ODtjf-om9sEDIT: heres reggie grabbing Chris Kamen's junk
SLAPAZZZZZZ
NO, RAFI!
your edit implies a link...but no link.....so here it ishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv1cBN8M-9I
Hoooooooly I do not remember that at all. The postgame interview was better than the sack grab."He grabbed my nuts. You can just say it, yeah."
So he conjured up a free throw for his own team? I'm imagining someone like McAdoo being called up just to play hack-a-steph now.Edit: Whoops, missed a critical word.
Keywords Former teammate
No, Reggie was visiting team, Korver was on the Jazz at the time. So it was like the old vet hassling his younger former teammate. I was like 20 feet away and it was definitely not malicious or anything. Kyle seemed happy to see him. Then the ref calls a tech and Kyle's going to the line.
I've always pictured Kyle Korver's mom going to every game, bringing him orange slices for half time and post game treats.Don't ask me why, I just look at Kyle Korver and see "my mom's here, maybe we can go to Burger King after the game but you probably can't sleep over".
Please someone get this to Korver so he actually does go to BK with his mom and a couple teammates after a game and instagrams a pic.
SLAP ASS
Well this is for two opponents, I can understand how refs could want to keep contact between oposing plays to a minimum, but for team mates as a distraction?My guess is they'd be called for a technical, or a team technical if there's such a thing. It's clearly a strategy to distract, which you could say is unsportsmanlike behavior.
Isn't is a strategy? IIRC there was a celtics play where Doc made Rondo just run to the other side of the court.Same thing?
That's different, you're just optimizing by getting Rondo out of the way.
We should have tried this.
That awkward moment when Rondo actually starts contributing on both ends of the floor just to spite the coach.
Yeah but then again so is trash talk, that's deliberately trying to get into an opponent's head so basically unsportsmanlike. So what if you frame the kissing as trash talk, trying to get in someone else's head. I'm pretty sure it would work with Al-Farouq Aminu.
Damn I need to start watching more WNBA
No you don't.

Holy shit
Magic and Zeke always kissed before the opening tip, never during an actual game. To the credit of late '80s humanity, people rarely made stupid gay jokes about the phenomenon.
JR doesn't make open 3's, silly.
correct, they would have to kiss in front of him while contesting the shot
I think 2 men kissing in front of JR trying to shoot would demolish anything amazing, shooting wise, Curry can ever even hope to do.
It'd be like Steve Kerr draining a buzzer beater with MJ and Pippen making out right in front of him. Legendary.
I'm sickened. But curious.
JR is actually much more likely to make it if a defender is kissing him as he's shooting, according to advanced analytics
I wrestled in high school and we had an older coach, he had been a referee for 20 plus years or so. We always asked him the most ridiculous questions, but he'd never break and always do his best to answer the question. One day we asked him what would happen if two guys started having sex on the mat. He just said "I'd probably give a double technical for unsportsmanlike conduct" and walked away. In any other context he would joke around with us, but he took his craft seriously. You remind me of him, OP.
If it were some kind of missionary style anal, ref would just probably count the pin.
Do you know how flexible the other party would have to be for missionary anal? At that point its damn nearly piledriver....
[deleted]
Gay guy here, can confirm it's not tough...but it is hard.
But at that point, isn't everything?
Man I just imagined if boners were tough, not hard. If they were tough, a lot of people would probably be into their dick being lightly chewed.
I'm impressed with how your mind works but also terrified.
So you've tried this?
You haven't?
Wish more redditors were like that. Too many unfunny joke replies in response to serious questions
You should be a coach
*Soundbites from the game...*  "Hey! Run Brokeback! Brokeback!"  "Wtf? That's the fourth time he's called this play."    "Ayy, no tongue this time goddamit! Leave your mouthguard in."  "Man, can you get him a mentos or *something*."
&gt; "Wtf? That's the fourth time he's called this play this quarter."
Aminu's calling plays now
Last season Aminu took himself out of the game with 1.8 seconds left on the clock because Terry Stotts drew up a play where Meyers Leonard took the final kiss instead of him
There was an episode of Hangin' with Mr. Cooper where he drew up a play that had one of the players get on all fours and bark like a dog as a distraction, and it led to the game winner.
In middle school we had a Teacher-Student game for a fundraiser and we ran a play where one of our players pretended to have a heart attack to get a bucket. Terrible actor though, they didn't stop playing defense at all so we were just a man down for the play.
Lol, maybe pick something more realistic for a teenager than a heart attack. I'm not sure Daniel Day-Lewis would have the acting chops to pull that off.
Hey, we were 13. Logic isn't all there.
He really shows that he can think outside the box.
I think that's a really, really bad pun, but I'm not 100% sure you meant it to be.
Aminu would have a nervous breakdown
"Gay gaygay GAY!""Aaand Aminu's man scores again"
"...Aminu's man..."Gaygay gay
From that day on, we all just knew him as Gaygay Gay
Sorry I might be a bit out of the loop here whats up with the comments about Aminu and gay shit?
[Example 1] (http://i.imgur.com/33tVUsb.png)[Example 2] (http://i.imgur.com/E1DJ3SF.png)[Example 3] (http://i.imgur.com/nnOoKSM.png)[Example 4] (http://i.imgur.com/mNNl0IX.png)[Example 5] (http://i.imgur.com/eqgABbp.png)[Example 6] (http://i.imgur.com/ioB4gPG.png)[Example 7] (http://i.imgur.com/aC1fqDA.png)[Ironic Example 8] (http://i.imgur.com/abAT9Xw.png)
Lol good lord, Aminu.
Aminu seems like a dude who would leave hate comments on a gay porn video after jerking off to it.
That last one is pretty gaygay gay
I notice that all these tweets are old. Hopefully he's evolved his mindset since then. I know 6 years ago I had some stupid beliefs too.
6-7 years ago he was 18-19 so hopefully, yeah.
There was a post during the playoffs where someone went back and found a bunch of really old tweets from NBA players. Aminu apparently used to tweet a bunch of homophobic shit.
I dunno, he'd probably get super turned on.
You are proposing a variation of the [dog barking play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OGdkoeqG0Q).  And I think you would be surprised at how poorly it would work in the NBA, especially since you just took LeBron and Kyrie out of the play.  Players try to distract each other all the time with trash talking or fakes or an elbow in the ribs.  They are usually very good at focusing during the play.
*"The Barker"*
That's fucking hilarious right there. I want a where are they now on Jason Holt.
According to the YouTube comments, four years ago he was an athletic director at some school.&gt;Jason Holt is my athletic director at my school ( the guy on all fours barking)!﻿
I love the internet
Reminds me of when melo was lying on the floor for like 2 possesions and everyone just played around him with the refs doing nothing.
Charles **Bark**ley, the wonder years.
Only if they say "no homo" first.
they have to compliment each others' masculine physiques after too.  Then it is super duper not gay.
And one has to slap the other on the ass as they turn to walk away. Then the slappee has to turn around and wink at the slapper.
... Just so everyone knows how NOT gay it is.
How unrealistic is this?JR doesnt make open shots.
Even for an offseason shit post, this is a bit much
You're just jealous you didn't think of it
I hereby motion that this Original Poster, and his or hers Original Content , be given the prestigious award of Shitpost of the Year. Do I hear an Aye supporting this motion?

Speaking of which, someone needs to make a compilation of best shit posts from this offseason
Can a big man or two fart super loud in the paint and then yell "FUCKING COME IN HERE BRON I DARE YOU" to force a jumpshot?
Reggie Miller has said that Drazen Petrovic smelled so bad that it actually made it harder to guard him.
An entire team should ignore any and all hygiene for a season.
No, they would call that a fragrant foul
Soccer player for Sweden got a red card for ripping ass not too long ago
Why stop there? What if they started giving each other over the pants hand jobs? What's the rule book say about that?
Double dribble
Loose ball foul
palming
5 second violation
Player control foul?
a flagrant two
In the NHL it's low-sticking
They'd go to jail probably
This has got to be one of my favorite shit posts in /r/NBA history.Visualize that shit and play it out.  Hysterical.
If it happened, then winning game 7 would be a footnote
It would STILL be getting around the clock coverage on ESPN today.
[Rumor] Kevin Love is jealous he hasn't gotten enough kisses from Lebron.
This is trending on bleacher report lol
I hadn't checked /r/nba in a few hours, and then I got the notification. Shitposting's officially made it to the big league boys
Bleacher Report ain't big league. It's just a site that steals content from other creators (like our beloved r/NBA offseason shitposts) and pins some ad revenue around it. It's a lower form of sports coverage than this sub for sure.
It's big league in that they are subsidized and pay actual salary to people, even it it's for stealing content. To the masses, B/R is just below ESPN for sports updates (I consider SI and most parts of SB Nation to be above the both of them), and it certainly does a good job of giving you a one-stop app for finding articles off of SI/ESPN/SB Nation etc concerning your favorite teams. Before I discovered Reddit, B/R was one of my main sports outlets for sure (comment sections were cancer even back then though)
Congratulations everyone, we've hit peak offseason. Nowhere to go but down (up?) from here.
you were just in my bleacher report update regarding this thread...
Lol it was awesome, I got a notification from B/R right as I opened this thread.
Make sure you don't do it against the Trailblazers. Al-Farouq Aminu might go crazy.

"Leaving JR open for an easy 3" is my new favourite example of an oxymoron

Rudy Gay
Not this fuckin' guy!
I just imagined LeBron James and Kyrie passionately making out while JR bricks an open three. I hate all of you.
THis actually happened in '52 at the time "french kissing" as we call it today had only been around for about 12 years, first pioneered by Jaque Poupon the kissing technique had swept first the nation of France, and then the world.  But, in America most people had never seen a French Kiss, as you can imagine it caused quite a stir.  The players who kissed were Abraham "shoes" malloy, the inventor of shoes (He actually wanted them to be called malloys, but the childhood gibberish nickname of "shoes" became the common name for the foot coverings we wear today) and Tommy "The Tree" Thompson who was the largest player in league history at the time measuring it at 5'11.It was the championship game, for all the marbles, and in those days 14 marbles would buy you a suckling pig so the stakes couldn't have been higher.  Well, the game was one of the highest scoring of the season, and after 4 quarters the teams were tied at 12-12.  Shoes and the Tree played for the Kansas City horseless Carriages, and apparently they'd come up with the idea after seeing the maneuver performed in France. It had become all the rage, as I said, and wasn't really viewed as sexual.  it was a common greeting between fathers and sons, friends, grandparents and grandchildren, literally everyone in france from about 1940 till the late 70's was jamming their tongue down the throat of nearly everyone they met.Thomson and Malloy knew the American audience wouldn't know what to think, so with only 2 minutes left in the game, and the opposing Boston Indian killers, (later changed to Native American killers) with the ball, they knew their chances of another possession were slim so they put their plan in action.  Well as you can guess, nobody saw it coming, the Indian Killers turned the ball over, and after 6 attempts, the Carriages pulled out a win.  There weren't referees in those days, the players called their own fouls, so no one knew what to do.  Except for Shoes and the Tree, they just stood at center court kissing and kissing.  Some people call it the greatest game ever played, hell, maybe the greatest moment in all of sport.
Game, blouses

Unsubbing from /r/nba for 2 months. See you at the start of the pre-season, guys!
Don't act like the offseason didn't teach you how to talk to your pops about basketball
I see you've been reading my NBA fan fiction
this is going to inspire Draymond to snapchat his dick mid play

man yall are spoiled lol The NFL offseason is fuckin gruesome compared to this shit
Never could get into football myself :p
Reddit has shit content all year
guys we'll be safe once summer ends, everyone knows these damn kids are banned from reddit for the other 271 days of the year.you're a cunt.
Andris Biedrins clearly has nothing better to do these days.
I'll be fine if I can just get through the couple weeks till 2k, that'll keep me sane through October.
So random, OP. XD *holds up spork*
Later
Wake up big fella we made it
Hell yeah
He definitely burst out laughing after he walked away out if earshot.
This reminds me of the "anonymous question box" that we had during sex ed classes and how funny we, as seventh graders, thought it would be to fill it with stupid questions. It helped that our teacher was a curmudgeonly older woman, too. The best ones I remember:Q: "Is it hard to have sex in a hammock?"A: "Well I would think so!"andQ: "If a girl is masturbating with the eraser end of a pencil--"A: "Never. Masturbate. With. A pencil."
Oh, I have a funny story revolving around that too. So from like 7th grade until my Sophomore year of high school I was obsessed with Dave Chappelle's stand up special "For What it's Worth." During the special he has a bit about a [homeless man jacking off on a bus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtqEknAtyQQ) which, if you can't watch the video, climaxes (HA!) with a guy taking a nut to his forehead and fearing that he has AIDS. So, in sex ed class, I had the brilliant idea to write "Can you get AIDS from a homeless man busting a nut on your forehead?" into the question box. My friend, will call him Kevin because that was his name, was the one who wrote it down and put it into the box (translation, it was my idea but I was too afraid of getting caught). When I told him what to write he misheard me and wrote down "Can you get AIDS from a homo busting a nut on your forehead." So for the next fifteen minutes or so our teacher had to explain about why that was so offensive and how we shouldn't believe stereotypes like that.Surprisingly, or maybe not considering our teacher actually answered our ridiculous joke question, the class was much more helpful than the horror stories that I've heard from other people's sex ed classes. We actually learned how to use a condom, about birth control, we even go to look at a diagram of a vagina that showed where the clitoris was and what it did.
I asked my high school wrestling coach if tickling was allowed. He asked if I was gay or dumb. I'm not gay.
note the smile on the ref's face in that screencap where he T'd up Taurasi
Wait, why are we ignoring the fact that JR would never take an open 3?
Ugh, double standards.
Your coach happen to be a Buckbee
You mean to say that you didn't stop reading?
How do we know this isn't Jason Kidd's alt account?
He should take over for Pop, this guys a fucking genius.
Uh, f-foul.... Double foul.
That seems dangerous for Isiah Thomas.
Man, it'll be a reverse hack a shaq
Someone at the Daily Mail managed to write an entire article without spelling "Phoenix" correctly.
"I was just trying to make sweet love" Tauarasi said of her kissing her opponent.
So now we know he contracted it.
There was actually somebody in the german basketball league two/three years ago who kissed his opponents to mess with them. He got a ban for it between two games in a Play-off series, but I can't remember if it was only for one game or more because it was the third game and we won 3-0.
I think it's along the same lines as the old barking dog play. You know the one where someone gets on their knees and barks like a dog to distract the other team while they inbound for an easy bucket. In middle school I ran that play successfully twice, once for a three and once for a layup, both game winners, but they were waived off for unsportsmanlike play.
Of all the people to be involved in an on-court kiss, I wouldn't have expected Magic.  Now, I see it was the 80s.  But in the 90s, after he was diagnosed with HIV, his return to the NBA was the very reason the league got super strict about anyone bleeding no matter how minor.
&gt;it's happened in the WNBA between two opposing playersPics or video? For science.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQso97lBAIANot as sexy as you're imagining
That's your opinion.
Magic then throw Isiah an elbow in the throat.Today would be LeBron and Curry kissing, then block his shot.
https://youtu.be/MVToi7Z_6YU?t=46s
Refs have a huge amount of freedom in what they can deem unsportsmanlike conduct: it's anything they think is disrupting the legal flow of the game. The players would almost certainly receive a technical for doing any kind of funny or weird stunt like this.
What if you two players from the same team kiss each other.
Holy shit the fact there is precedent for this amazes me!
I guess the AIDS makes more sense now.
It would be considered a pushing foul to me. Plus unecessary contact. Probably a flagrant 1.
So lesbians get fouled, but magic Johnson can get away with some sugar? I call shenanigans
Seems backwards. I'm ok with WNBA players kissing...
We did it reddit!
Both of those are players on the opposite teams though. You are allowed to touch your own teammates, right? Like high-fives and stuff.A kiss is just a high-five with your mouths.
&gt; Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas kissingUm. Isiah, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Of course it was Magic Johnson
Put me in coach....Im ready to gay....today
[deleted]
Probably because Jesus-Converts-The-Queers camp didn't work on you fully.
I wish Diana Taurasi would kiss me.
Well.. there's contact.. so I would guess it's a foul.
&gt;According to this article and this article, it's happened in the WNBA between two opposing players, and both players were called for a foul.Oh shit it actually happened. They did both kinda foul each other though too.
"Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas kissing"So that's how Magic got AIDS.
And that's how he got aids, right? /s
He only makes contested ones
The Pistons/Thomas beat Magic Johnson so bad in 1990, that it gave him AIDS.
That's not how it works
Just HIV then?
Perfect.
I tried to come up with an HIV Magic Johnson joke that wasn't taseless, I failed.
Translation:  "I have nothing interesting to say but upvote me anyway!"

They tried it in handball. Let me see if I can find the clip.......Ah, [here we go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NY69uPZyTA). Guess it worked given that the opponent was sent off for the reaction.
But why did the guy pull his pants down?
You mean Ivan Stuffer?
Can't believe Jason Collins and Vince Carter were on the same team and never tried this.
At first I thought you meant kissing players on the other team, which would *definitely* be a technical foul, but worth it just to see if Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is into you.
Terrible strategy. JR would much rather take a contested jumper than an open one
i wonder if JR pulling out the pipe and offering it to the crowd as a distraction is a tech?
Because the action has nothing to do with sports, it's unsportsmanlike. Same goes for miming, laying on the floor, patty cake, you get the idea.
I feel like this is a slippery slope to becoming Baseketball
Most sports have a very broad "sportsmanlike conduct" rule.  So basically you would get a tech for something like this.  It's similar to the "can you tickle your opponent" question in MMA.
i suddenly want to watch baseketball
Not even close to what you're talking about, But I remember Dennis Rodman would touch Karl Malone in... Certain areas/ways and whisper erotic things into his ear.
to be fair what DIDN'T Dennis Rodman do
Did I just get a Bleacher Report notification for this?
Is this Eric Andre?
High quality shitpost right here
This is the first part of the transition from the NBA to the NBGAY
my kind of league tbh
NBHeeeeey
I've got lame puns for NBDays
So you offseason is here and you're fantasizing over two men kissing while shooting a 3 pointer...
Just make sure Bill Kennedy isn't present or he will join in
It would be so funny if the defenders just stayed locked up and they didn't score after that.
Now THIS is shitposting
This is so gay. So so gay.  Please bear with me I need to put it out into the universe.I had a dream this past season that players used on-court blowjobs on each other as screens.  Like Tristan had to go up and suck Steph's dick in my dream to distract him from Kyrie's handles/movement. It was the gayest moment in my life I have no idea why my brain did that. Hahahahahaha
For you https://youtu.be/0kot6JND1uQ
Hahahahahahahahahahahah I legit did a spit take all over my iPad. Fuck that was funny hahaha thanks for the laughs!

I mean for real that was kinda baller tho.  Like if you ain't scared when someone fronts you that's the perfect way to express it...if you a girl.
good one.
i'll be back to this sub in 47 days im done
My bleacher report just told me about this.. what the fuck. Fuck you op for "going viral" and annoying me twice
Lmao we made it onto Bleacher Report
Bleacher Report sent me here lmao
I didn't think anyone would ever top the question of whether conjoined twins would count as one player or two, but here we are.
Well what was the answer? One or two?
I think the mods deleted it before there was a solid answer. But my gut says it's 1.  &amp;nbsp;  It did spawn a good thread of if the answer is 1, which two players would you sew together? I think it was like Curry + Shaq.
[Shaq's already played with someone attached to him](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8im016E-4X8/hqdefault.jpg)
"Curry + Shaq"Oh god lol
I should just do an unreliable oral history of the thread. I think the thought process was that you'd need somebody huge who could just carry the smaller guy on his back. Obvs this is Shaq.
lmao. Then Shaq just turns around and curry sticking out of his back drops the three.
And you've made on Bleacher Report. Congrats hahaha
Only if Rudy Gay, Kevin Love, and Ramon Sessions are on the same team.
Kissing your own teammate is allowed, kissing an opponent, particular one that is not receptive will be called a blocking foul and/or sexual assault.
How many free throws you get for a sexual assault foul?
We men, you can assume
This was so well played, its a shame it's buried so far down in this thread. Have an upvote and just know you deserve many more than you'll be getting for this comment.
LOL thanks fam
*hits yaoi alarm*
Shitpost of the year!Others put in a lot more effort into theirs, but in the end it doesn't even matter.
Yeah they could but they'll probably get hit with one of these: http://imgur.com/gallery/T1kbk
If you are talking about a consenting kiss by teammates I don't think anything would be called, although the league would definitely provide guidance and maybe add a rule about shocking displays meant to distract. Any kiss of an opposing player would not only be a foul, it would be sexual assault.
Its basketball not Baseketball
Don't give Pop any ideas you bastard.
Preseason can't get here fast enough.
When I woke up this morning, didn't think I'd see Cavs fan fiction in r/nba
This is officially my favourite offseason post. Well done OP
&gt;["Kiss me."](http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/graphics/gif/jasonkidd.gif)
Pauly and Artest back in the day http://i.imgur.com/AORHEfS.jpg
If it'a unwanted then I don't see how it wouldn't be sexual harassment.
Quality Shit Post.  Quality.
Question is pointless. JR would never hit an open 3.
I've been training to achieve erections at will as a way to improve my post defense. I firmly believe this is why we don't see much of the low post game in the NBA anymore.
When you get featured on Bleacher Report
This just hit Bleacher Report, congrats dude!
Well let's break down the word "unsportsmanlike." If a sportsman is a man playing sports, then technically kissing another player in the middle of a game would have nothing to do with sports; therefore being quite astutely: unsportsmanlike. Nice fantasy though.

Deandre Jordan retires due to sexual abuse

"Not enough tongue"
Question OP. Why would Lebron and Kyrie kiss? I'd get lebron out there to kiss Draymond.
Brooooo....
Yup, these are my readers.
Hands doen....this has to be the funniest serious question asked here on reddit
Have to admit, I laughed.
Or better, kiss someone who is posting up on you. Would definitely throw them off.
Don't give [Lance Stephenson](http://imgur.com/waPYs7y) any ideas.
Don't give Gary Harris any ideas
Quality shot pist.
Nice one.
Great strategy idea. Getting someone like JJ Redick and Deandre Jordan to kiss while on offense to open up a clear lane for CP3 could be a great game winning play.
You don't want JR taking open shots. He can only shoot when contested by 10 people.
Yes, classical thread, I'm finally going to write my name in /r/nba history, here we go.....No, but It would be hot.
What if it all just broke out into orgy
We men.
AWWWWW SUMMER '16.
Didn't Chuck kiss Dick on the mouth?
In highschool we use to tell this kid to wear deodorant and he would say no. I want to make sure I smell like shit and see these fuckers guard me, we won a lot of HS basketball because of him
Is no one going to being up that this would be sexual harassment in the workplace?
This is, without a doubt, my favorite question ever posed on reddit. So thank you for this.
I can't even begin to explain how dumb this is.
I just started imagining Lebron and Kyrie full out kissing with tongue action involved. Yikes.
Wtf, Warriors didn't blow a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals for this shit
OP you browse r/leagueoflegends don't you?
You know, when I read the title of this post.. I was assuming you were talking players kissing other players as a means of playing defense. For instance, Lance Stephenson (first name to come to mind) kissed an opposing player on the back of head, or neck, while they are backing him down at the elbow or wherever. Now *that* would have been interesting to read comments about, however I'm sure there wouldn't be many. Every one would probably say that would be classified as a personal and/or technical foul as well as a potential harassment fine or suspension.
"Actions unnatural to the game of basketball."
god damn #1 on r/all
Bleacher Report is reporting on this post..... what is sports media becoming?
It would be distracting and not part of the action on the court so I think it should be a double technical.
We had an inbound play in high school where one of our guys would get down on the floor and bark like a dog lmaoooooo
"*blows whistle* foul!" "for what!?" "excessive gayness!"

Just stopping by to say great username.
Where's the bitch-hold-on card when you need it
YOU CAN'T STOP LOVE
yes, it's 2016
Oh. So this is the topic my push notification from bleacher report was telling me about.
Much like the rules of Baseketball
~_~
Its only ok if it was Jason Collins and Dennis Rodman
When I was in boot camp, before Don't Ask, Don't Tell was repealed, it was apparently a common strategy among some regretful recruits to earn a discharge by feigning homosexuality. The story, as told to my platoon by our PMI, was that a few cycles before two recruits just dropped their rifles and started making out with each other right on the firing line. Their punishment was no one stopped them, and they were forced to awkwardly kiss until they gave up, and then endure the rest of boot camp with their shame.
I'd werk off to this
One thing I do know is what the banner on r/NBA would be that night.
I can think of someone who wishes it werehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1H5M1Y_NRQ

Exploited. They can't come up with their own original content.
0.5st world problems
I like offseason posts, but this is trying too hard.
Legal for the Cavs to kiss my ass
legal .probably yes.unsportsmanlike conduct/buffonary technical. ... HELL YESWe should leave the acting bullshit to soccer players.No place for that in Basketball
Half the fouls given in the NBA are predicated on acting, though. So it's already here in basketball.
[deleted]
Not if Kyrie agrees
Yeah he might be into kinky shit
Kinky Irving has a nice ring to it
Kyrie agrees for sure, he takes one for the team
Didn't get to read description till now, assumed it would be about kissing other team. If Kyrie agrees I'm all for it, probably a better strategy than the triangle
by engaging in sexual behavior in the workplace, they are creating a hostile environment for their colleagues who may not be comfortable with public displays of affection.
Someone took their managerial discrimination and harassment training seriously.
Fuck off bleacher report. Fucking lames.
O waddup boi
That is called sexual harassment.
Not if they're kissing each other
When I read the OP, I envisioned one player kissing another unwilling player to distract or anger them, not two players consentually kissing.
Wow LGBTQ community just wants everyone to be gay now. First Captain America and now LeBron, where will it end?
MAKE AMERICA GAY AGAIN
Jesus Christ you people are out of control with your gay agenda.
Lol
Holy shit please no
This post made the B/R app hahahahaha
IIRC, Trey Parker and Matt Stone [made a documentary about this tactic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWSNZe4tGiY)...
It's hot, whatever it is.
If Lebron and Kyrie started making out, Steph Curry could star in a sitcom called 'My Two Daddies'.
Annnd I just got a bleacher report notification on this
Guys, we got onto [Bleacher Report!](https://imgur.com/a/FnX0H) Shoutout to u/scarecrowbar for putting us on the global basketball radar
Depends, if there's too much tongue then its flagrant kissing and the other team gets two shots and the ball
What would happen if Kyrie kissed LeBron's leg?
I came looking for this.  Thanks.
I just got a B/R notice for this... Wtf lol
Just got a B/R notification about this lol
This is legal unless you're playing in Charlotte
If you come out of the closet might as well do it with a bang.
Good job you made it to BR.
Ah, the ol' Air Bud logic. "No where in the rules does it say that two teammates can't make out"
If the kiss is real and they both move in 2getha and adopt kids then yeah. Points count i guess
(SERIOUS) Rule 12 Section V of the 2015-2016 NBA rule book would be the most likely place to find something like this (on mobile, so forgive formatting):An official may assess a technical foul, without prior warning, at any time. A techni-cal foul(s) may be assessed to any player on the court or anyone seated on the bench for con-duct which, in the opinion of an official, is detrimental to the game. The technical foul mustbe charged to an individual. A technical foul cannot be assessed for physical contact whenthe ball is alive.EXCEPTION: Fighting fouls and/or taunting with physical contact.The official could rule that this was conduct detrimental to the game, and that it qualifies as taunting with physical contact. However, I don't know of any precedent of such a taunting ruling between two players of the same team during a live ball situation.In reality, an NBA defense would likely recognize the lack of spacing on the weak side of the offense and send an extra defender to the strong side. Smith's defender would be unaffected by the kissing, as his reactions would likely be too fast for the kissing to begin and grab his attention, unless the defender is James Harden. An official would likely ignore the kissing, but he would have the discretion, per the rulebook, to assess a taunting technical foul to either LeBron, Kyrie or both, resulting in one technical foul shot per tech. Depending on if JR got the shot up before the kiss, the shot may or may not count.
&gt; A technical foul cannot be assessed for physical contact when the ball is alive.this is definitely physical contact tho right?
The exception clause provides for assessing the technical in the case of physical contact for taunting. While this exception is obviously intended for contact with an opposing player, the verbiage does not explicitly exclude contact between teammates to be considered as a part of this exception. It's a stretch, but technically applicable by the letter of the rule since it does leave room for ref interpretation.
Let's turn it up even more, what if Lebrun and Kyrie started having full on steamy butt sex, that would definitely be more distracting than making out
Adam Silver pls
Yes pleasehttp://imgur.com/a/QadRG
This is the greatest post in r/nba history. Congrats.
#Lmfoa this thread is pure gold
You're not a man till you've had a man.
This reminds me of the Mighty Ducks movie where coach Bombay gets that   figure skater player to start spinning on the ice to distract the other team, leading to an easy goal when they all stop to stare.
Unsportsmanlike
Foul! No....  Two fouls!
Thank god the cavs are so good they don't need to kiss. Maybe durant and Thompson can start this strategy
my guess is, the refs would let players kiss, *unless* it was part of a strategy...then they'd probably call a tech or something
oh jesus! I thought you meant like Lebron trying to kiss Dray or something. I mean, Dray did touch Bron's balls, it's only right to pay him back in a "kill'em with kindness" sort of way!
I think it would be really effective in on ball defense. You think you're getting a shot up as Draymond plants one on you? Good luck.
lol
i could see draymond taking advantage of this
While they're focusing on each other, they're not protecting their jewels
We've all gone delirious. *Lord keep my sanity whole and lead me not into shitposting. Amen for three.*
I've thought about a strategy of "no one brush your teeth and breathe hard at them" Think how gross that would be.
Quality shit post.
Nope.  Back in the 80s and 90s, the game had much more contact.  Since they implemented the hand check and kiss rule, the game has become soft.
Aminu would go crazy! I can only imagine his tweets if that happened in a game
For those uninformed: Aminu hates / is scared of gay people.  Like, a lot.
Back when I played CYO ball as a kid, I would try to dance with opposing players and basically do any batshit crazy thing I could to distract the defense. It didn't work.
This is just the gay version of the bark like a dog play.
What the fuck
\#lightyears
tmac and vince carter should try this, after all they are the kissing cousins.stupidest nickname ever btw.also i think it'd be a legal play except in the more conservative states. no really, it's up to the defense to guard JR and not be distracted.
Computer Blue.
Read title and thought the scenario would be like one player kissing opposing player, via Dennis Rodman "he homo?" mental move.  OP goes in another direction and goes on a hypothetical of Kyrie and Lebron making out mid game... unexpected.
God damnit. Are we really at this point in the offseason
We need an offseason shitpost MVP award cause this is it right here.
Your question has no basis in reality, I don't know what you're expecting. JR Smith would not hit an open 3.
Lets get the guys from r/writingprompts to get some steamy LeBron fan fiction cooking...
"I'd rather take a contested shot than an open shot any day" - Swish, though
This is hilarious!
Holy hell I just got an update from bleacher report on my phone. We made it fam.
I love you brohttp://imgur.com/zdLUiC8
You fuckin made bleacher report dawg good job
This is basically the film baseketball.
I imagine the kissed player could still have the aggressor prosecuted for sexual assault in regular courts, and that criminal case would give the NBA a reason to punish/ban them.
On the floor it would be a tech. The Appeal would be interesting though.
When I was boxing out I used to subtly pull the other guys shorts down and go for the rebound while he was trying to keep his pants up. Never once got the whistle blown for it
It's legal in baseketball so I guess it's legal in basketball.
Not sure what would happen game-wise, but Steph kissing Klay seems like a much more likely scenario.
&gt;Bleacher Report took the link for this. Do I feel proud or exploited?both. feel proud they exploited you.
ESPN would make it the next lebron stat
Well when I'd play two player mode San Andreas with my brother, it was my strategy to piss him off, so I'd always kiss whoever he was playing as.
What happens when Ezreal kisses Shyvanna's leg?
SUS
Ok, I don't even follow basketball but I'm subbing.
Wouldn't work: JR would miss the 3
Hopefully
"You know how I know you're gay?"
r/gaybasketball ?
pause
Wat.
Classic BASEketball psych out, completely legal.Oh wait this is NBA, not NBL, carry on ;)
thats fukin gay
No. It's a case of legal consent. Players consent to contact within the rules of the game, and blatantly breaking a rule opens you up to civil and criminal charges. It has happened in ice hockey numerous times for excessive contact and postgame fights. Kissing someone without consent is battery, but 99% of players would let it go
It's sexual assault.
I'd imagine it'd be sexual assault right?
dumbest what ifyo what ifdumb
gay warriors fans no surprise since it's the bay area
Hoops Hype just tweeted a picture of OP's post
Legendary post.
What kind of kissing we talking about? Like full-on tongue down throat?
I just got a bleacher report notification for this and it mentioned OPs username. We out here for real
by that logic, no reason they couldn't butt bang on the court too, yeah? It doesn't say in the rules that you CANT lick each other's shafts...they don't call it the poophole loophole for nothing
Championship level shitpost
I'm gone for like 5 hours, guys wtf has this subreddit gone to? Anyways, upvoted.
Mods please sticky.
This is the worst shit ever.
I haven't laughed this hard at original content on Reddit since I first discovered /r/justneckbeardthings well done
holy offseason
Suddenly I find myself interested in sports.
always thought what would happen if i took off my pants and just ran at them rockin a boner

What if they actually tried this and JR missed so it was pointless
Shit post to end all shit posts.
I Don't see why not.
Lol if they call it unsportsmanlike conduct they'll be called bigots as Kyrie and LeBron are merely expressing their homosexual tendencies in a tense time
Based on Mo Peterson being ejected for slapping back Vince Carter, the guy who initiated the kiss would be fine, but the guy who reciprocates the kiss would be ejected from the game.
Now this is the shitpost I've been waiting for. A+!
I'd say Kelly Oubre Jr better watch his backside. And Lowry, for that matter.
It wouldn't work at all. Unfortunately, NBA players aren't cartoons.In Space Jam world, on the other hand...
Thank you for posting the true champion of all shit posts. Wrap it up, boys.
sounds a bit like the ole barking dog play http://deadspin.com/5161730/the-barking-dog-play-is-idiotic-effective
Where does it end? Once players are no longer distracted by the kiss, then what? Rusty trombone at half court?
/u/tolop
Reddit can be such a weird place some times.
this is giving me a good idea for intramurals
My friend played basketball in high school in the early 00's. At the time, WWF was huge. One of out favorite wrestlers was Goldust. He would play mind games with the othercwrestlers- blow kisses, lick his tongue, etc.  He would use that for a strategy lol
what about setting fruity picks?
Hey man I'm not on your team
&gt;I don't see how this is unsportsmanlikeMaking out wouldn't be unsportsmanlike on its own, but doing so with pure intention to distract the opponents would be
Wait, wouldn't this scenario actually hurt the Cavaliers? JR shoots better with a hand in his face than a wide open shot.
There's a Jason Collins joke in here somewhere
Ummm that is super sportsmanlike, I don't know why you'd think there might be a whistle.
My favorite shitpost. Better than the nfl, aaron rodgers-alex smith fan erotica
sus.
Welcome back, Jason Collins.
I wanted to post "If Lebron announced he was going to play Tight End for the Browns this season, in what round would you take him in your fantasy draft?" But then I was like, "nahh, thats too dumb." And then this comes along..
ESPN would get the biggest money boner
Nobody wants to play sportsball the fun way, everyone wants to just be as boring as fucking possible.
Congrats. The post that finally got me to delete my subscription to this sub.
We did it!
No ones going to miss you.Actually scratch that.Everyone is happy you are  gone.
