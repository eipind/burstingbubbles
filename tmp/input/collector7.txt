&gt;"I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that," James told ESPN. "I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.holy shit
And didn't r/nba say LBJ was one of the least quotable superstars. Holy fuck was that some straight fire.
I can't wait to hear Charles' comeback to this if he even has one. Lebron just fucking roasted him.
Especially since LeBron is not one to do this either - makes it an extra toasty roasting. Chuck about to lose some weight over all this sweat.
LeBron just went straight up Game 6 in Boston on Charles ass.He realizes the Cavs, and probably even himself, have got complacent after that title win last year.LeBron thrives off using anything as motivation and quite honestly I'm surprised we haven't seen something like this from him before, especially since he by far and away gets more unwarranted shit than any other player in professional sports.Barkley may have very well just woke up the beast. It will be interesting to see if LeBron backs down from these comments or if he straight up goes back to being the villain and wanting to kill the league
Villain LeBron Returns please! On some Empire Strikes Back shit. Someone get the carbon black mask
I just don't think the villain LeBron  persona could compete with the next level Evil League of Evil over on the dark coast.
[ooo Thursday on TNT...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBaYVo89mmY)
LeBron is 32. Give a fuck mode was already dwindling.I'm surprised he made it that long.
Idk he still wants to surpass mike so I'm sure he isn't like welp I finally got one for the land time to chill
I'm loving Idgaf bron right now.
I'm beginning to think he went into this season aware that his quote game was something that was weakening his legacy, so he aimed to fix it.
Nba is so juicy right now god damn
best league in the world
Ok but don't you want to hear about Brady being handed the trophy by goodell?
lmao, right? LeBron ethering Barkley &gt; anything that's happened so far in the NFL playoffs.
I mean, that cowboys/Green Bay game was one for the ages...
god damn that game was too much. rodgers is a god
how bout this bs https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3eTcZsVYAEZQBB.jpgdude could just say he's focused on SB prep. acting like nothing is happening is ignorantedit: to those that disagree, netw3rk just tweeted something along the same lines: https://twitter.com/netw3rk/status/826473703022149632
Brady has always been like that though. Frankly, I think the only thing he cares about is football and his family...probably in that order
He is basically white Michael Jordan.
THATS WHY I FUCKED YOUR BITCH YOU FAT MOTHER FUCKA
*Take money*
First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
But Chuck never denies being who he is... he isn't the moral compass Lebron should comparing himself to, I think this is a good burn but not in this context.
Yeah, this attack doesn't really answer the criticism. Chuck has already admitted to all the things Lebron mentions, so it's not like he's being hypocritical either. Just because Charles Barkley criticizes Lebron instead of someone else doesn't make what he says any less true. I kinda think Lebron deflected away from the substance of the matter with this ad hominem attack.  I'm saying this as someone who's been a Lebron fan and was cool with "the decision"
I think the point is largely: "Fuck that guy and all the shit he talks.  He's an asshole."
Lol this would be a good burn no matter the context
He listed a bunch of things Chuck has openly discussed in the past. Has LeBron ever been straight up about anything? Even this little tirade was a deflection away from Chuck's criticism.
Exactly, it makes LeBron look insecure. Obviously LeBron is a model citizen and Chuck is not, but Chuck is upfront about his flaws. LeBron has flaws too. They're smaller flaws, but the difference is LeBron never owns up to them.

&gt;Michael bought Charles a $20,000 diamond earring. Johnny asked MJ, “what did you do all that for?” Michael responded, “he won’t get in my way the rest of the series, what’s $20,000 to me? Charles thinks we’re great friends. I hate that fat fuck.” Jordan dropped 55 in game 4 and Barkley never touched him once.If I had to be honest, it sounds like MJ was simply encouraging Barkley to keep being friendly to him (MJ) to prevent any competitiveness to come out of Barkley. We all know MJ is a snake competitively. Dude invites people to dinners before games just to drown their killer instinct.
Barkley said this story is not true.
Well he is the one being kept out of this, so not sure how much I'd take Barkley's word for it. Even Pippen confirmed that MJ never liked Barkley's guts when he fell out with the Rockets and said something along the lines of "I should've listened to Michael". This was on audio too.
MJ said that story wasn't true
Whoa, these dudes are denying stories that paint them in a kinda negative light?
Jordan talked about how he felt bad for his kids cause they'd never be as good at anything as he was, at his hall of fame acceptance speechThis is not the most filtered dude out there. I don't think he cares
To be fair, this still doesn't really refute Charles's claim that Lebron is asking way too much of Dan Gilbert and the Cavs organization. They're massively overpaying his friends and Lebron is complaining about not having good role players when there is no money left.
Lebron didn't get All-Defensive team only for basketball.
Fuck that's good banter
He's asking to trade for a backup point guard, someone who can average more than 3 assists per game (No one on the Cavs beside LeBron and Kyrie are averaging more than 2apg). That's really not asking for much. That whole dilemma got blown out of proportion
It kind of is when they have no one to trade that isn't saddled with a big contract.
I wish anyone on the Thunder aside from Westbrook could average more than 3 assists per game. Hell, I wish Westbrook had a star to back him up like Kyrie or Kevin Love. LeBron has an embarrassment of riches. It might not be a perfect roster, it might not be enough to beat the Warriors, but no one else has enough to beat the Warriors right now either. He shouldn't make the team's shortcomings public, no other star is bitching about what they've got right now. (well okay, Butler and Wade, but that's mostly directed at their teammates and that also shouldn't be happening publicly)I've liked LeBron since he returned to the Cavs, honestly, but he's being a little ridiculous and he can help the team by sucking it up and keeping this shit behind closed doors. I'm sure Griffin is just as aware of the fact that they need a backup PG as LeBron is.
&gt;they're massively overpaying his friendsI mean, is Tristan's contracts really that bad compared to say Evan Turner's or Mozgov's? It's a new era as far as guys getting paidand Tristan is a crucial, borderline irreplaceable piece to the team.Now, Lebron's new contract....
this man basically just implied barkley broke as hell and that's why he's doing inside the nba
I mean...that's well documented. Wasn't he bankrupt just a few years ago? His gambling habits haven't gone anywhere IIRC
You recall horribly wrong. He was never bankrupt or anywhere near it.
Man, I have no idea what to believe
It's easy. There's never been any reports of Barkley being broke and/or bankrupt. This whole misconception stems from an incident where Barkley didn't pay the Wynn $400,000 in chips they extended to him in a timely manner and got sued. A few days later, he send them a check for the $400,000 and everything was cleared up. That's all it was. For some reason, a bunch of people took that as Barkley was bankrupt.
To be fair, people are really dumb.

lol, "my karma plan"...got himself a reddit 401k
Holy shit this is fucking HUGE.LeBron fucking JAMES of all people is having a public feud with someone. This is the most out-of-character I have ever seen anyone.
I seriously can't remember the last time he called someone out like this...he must have been really pissed.
maybe has to do with frustrations with the team as well?
It's because LeBron can't go a day in his fucking life without people constantly giving him shit. I'm surprised it took this long for him to blow up.Dude is a 3 time champion and probably the second greatest player of all-time in my opinion and still gets disrespected on the daily. He just brought his hometown team and a title and it still isn't good enough.  Barkley just woke the sleeping giant because from here on out I can guarantee you LeBron is going to try and kill every team they play.It's about getting the team back on track here and he knows he needs to be in kill mode if everyone else is gonna follow
Exactly. LeBron is about to tap into playoffs mode. Zero Dark Thirty is a go.
Playoff Lebron in Febuary? it's like Christmas.
A Celtics fan excited for playoff LeBron? Shouldn't you be triggered instead?
Please tell me one fan who doesn't objectively enjoy watching playoff Lebron.
Ooh I'm getting sweaty just thinking about playoff lebron for an extra few months
Inside The NBA gonna be lit on Thursday
I'll make the game thread
Please do and post highlights lmao
Charles has to fire back and defend his name. these shots were so precise and viscous. I still can't believe they're real
Bron was probably stewing on them for a while in his head
Probably took all his restraint not to go"Fucking Sir Chunk lookin-ass, fucking sounds like he's got a churro in his mouth lookin-ass, fucking doesn't know 3&gt;2 lookin-ass"Btw I like chuck and think LeBron may have gone too far when talking about him only fling TNT for the paycheck, but on the other hand this was long overdue after all the undeserved flack LeBron gets, with Chuck even saying LeBron "doesn't wanna compete" last week. I like both guys but have to side with Kenton on this one
This is LeBron's lost verse on Hit 'em Up
Charles Barkley and Phil Jackson some mark ass bitches
Call the cops when you see The Block
We keep on coming when we dunkin on you foolsSteady gunning with jumper addin' twoYou know the rules
Skip Bayless, go ask your spurs how I'll leave yacut your old ass up, sinking threes, now concede defeat
Does this mean Lebron is saying fuck Barkley as a staff, record label, and crew? Because I feel like that would also mean he's saying fuck you to Ernie, and I don't feel like my man Ernie deserves that.
Don't Kenny got sickle cell or something?
Jesus Christ I have *never* heard LeBron talk like this to anyone...
He's probably trying to take the heat off of his team.  If everyone's focusing their attention on Lebron's personal issue, then there's less heat on the team for going 7-8.  Lebrons team probably just hasn't been in the position for him to do it.  Mourinho does it all the time
Yea but that's in character for Mourinho, Lebron on the other hand never attacks to deflect
Now wait just a goddamn minute. He's the one who put the team on heat by blasting them publicly so this makes no sense. He's just firing back at Charles right now.
So instead of passive aggressive LeBron we get aggressive LeBron.
LeImGettingMyBelt James
"I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that," James told ESPN. "I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying."All I've done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way. Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that."- LeBurn James
He's just setting himself up for the takedown:"I'm not the one that put on an ESPN special to quit my home state team.""I'm not the one who forced every trade the Cavs made and then complained when the owner spent the most money in NBA history on my roster."
He's also not the one who won 3 rings lol
Imagine not enjoying the roast of Charles Barkley and making stupid points like this.
none of that sounds as bad tbh
The most money in NBA history part isn't fair this is the biggest the cap has ever been, and LBJ coming back to CLE and winning a ring made the ownership more money than they'll ever spend on the roster
Does this mean Barkley will like the Warriors in the playoffs this year? Are the Cavs gonna be the new bitch jump shooting team who got lucky?
[deleted]
What's even funnier is that the Cavs are more of a jump shooting team than us
That's probably because the Cavs inside game opens up jumpers and the warriors shooting skill opens up drives.
LOL, if that is what he has to say for Chuck, can you imagine what he has to say to Skip fucking Bayless?
chuck is a legend of the game. people who follow basketball will actually care for what he has to say.Skip, nobody cares.
I feel like players don't give a single shit what guys like Skip or Stephen A Smith say. Chuck is in the Hall of Fame, so it's a different story, even if he does sometimes come out with hot takes that are just as stupid as those other guys
Skip isn't even worth his time. He is way too irrelevant.
Jalen Rose will forever be a legend for this.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLH0wOK92pgWater Pistol Pete JR.
It was so savage that Skip had to get Stephen A. to back him up the next show and Jalen was never on the show again.
The underrated part of that segment was Jalen completely blanking Stephen A. for a whole minute on national television.http://streamable.com/0fmigEDIT- La Source -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWiMrKTjMw0
I liked Stephen A's frustrated grunt when the camera cut away from him and Jalen continued to ignore the shit out of him.
Ahaha this is ridiculously satisfying. SAS's 'exasperated' gesticulation schtick actually becomes genuine when Jalen treats him like a child screaming "dad! dad!" at a grocery storeThat grunt of frustration near the end kills me
&gt;"I went to see Melo at the Garden two years ago when we were in New York," James said. "They played Portland. I went up to a suite at halftime and Phil Jackson didn't say one word to me."&gt;This fall, of course, Jackson brought up James' name unprompted in an interview with ESPN's Jackie MacMullan and described him and his close circle of business associates -- Paul, Maverick Carter and Randy Mims -- as his "posse."&gt;"I'm here to win ball games and take care of my teammates and take care of my, what's that word, oh, my 'posse,' " James said, animatedly.boy, he has no regard for human life. he's about to burn every bridge and go ronin
Uh, LeBron humiliated and gutted the Cavs on public TV in 2010, made the finals four times with the Heat, then got the owner who publicly trashed him to take him back, get him Kevin Love, and then won a ring. No one burns bridges with LeBron. He goes wherever he fucking wants.
He takes the bridge with him..............ask Golden State.
Bruhh
THIS SEEMS SO FAKE BUT WOOOW
I honestly had to make sure it was the real ESPN and not some phishing site that borrowed their layout. Holy fuck
for real. Some of his comments sounded soooo out of character.
I still don't believe he said "there's a new sheriff in town."
I do. Lebron always has had a flair for the dramatic
He probably giggled to himself after he made that comment lmao
"I know he wanted to retire a long time ago but he can't," James said. "He's stuck up on that stage every week."He then issued a challenge, of sorts."And if this makes him want to talk to me, the schedule's out there," James said. "He knows every road arena I'll be in. Don't just come up to me at All-Star and shake my hand and smile.""I'm tired of biting my tongue," James said. "There's a new sheriff in town."HOLY SHIT. LeBron just went all out..... I'm actually impressed. Finally some real emotion from him and not some PR crap.
This is the part I don't understand, is he saying Barkleys "broke" and that's why he's on TNT every week ?
Ya, Chuck is known (or at least strongly rumored) to have a gambling problem so Lebron is implying that he still needs to do TV because he's blown so much of his money on gambling
That's definitely what he was getting at which makes this shit all kinds of fucked up and beautiful at the same time.
I don't think Barkley's is completely broke. I just think Lebron means that despite earning a fair amount during his career, Charles hasn't made proper investments so he still has to hold a job.
&gt; Charles hasn't made proper investmentsa polite way to say that he gambled away generational wealth
I'm sorry but everyone here seems to be okay with Lebron ripping Charles personally.....Charles Barkley gets paid to be on TV for his opinion. If Lebron doesn't like it, turn off the TV. All Lebron does in this interview is attack Barkley's personal life / character, as funny as some of the remarks may be it is definitely out of line. I can't be the only one that thinks this?
I agree with you so that makes atleast two.
completely agree, i thought that shit was way overboard
Yes but LeBron can also express his own opinion no? He doesn't have to sit there and take shit from Charles Barkley, this is the risk you run when you sit behind that desk and talk shit.
Lbj is going to regret this. His feelings on Barkley are totally acceptable as everyone deserves an opinion but I'm not sure why he would highlight Charles past transgressions like the all star game drunkenness. He should have focused on why barkleys criticism was wrong not attack his character. I forgot which reporter who said this but basically they alluded to the fact that "every thing we talk about or write is only 30% of what we know".I expect Charles to either unleash or just dead the feud asap.
Agreed, total ad hominem attack. I mean it's funny and entertaining don't get me wrong but he seems to be deflecting
It's ok for Lebron to take criticism like a child. This sub will find a way to spin it and defend it.  Chuck will hit him back about running to Miami and back to Cleveland and they'll act like they like each other next time Lebron is on tv
I don't know why you were downvoted. He is handling this like a child. He took criticism from Charles, and then made it incredibly personal by bringing up all the mistakes Charles has made in his life.
Damn, you don't expect this kinda stuff from LeBron. Chuck must've really pissed him off.
Chuck basically said he had no competitive spirit last week. I'm surprised it took Lebron this long.
Doesn't help when you're in a bad mood. Cavs just lost a game to the Mavs.We all get cranky and annoyed by stuff we'd normally brush off when we're in a bad mood.
Sounds like he's been holding this in for a while with how detailed it was.  Had enough after tonight
Definitely been holding this. He had some smooth ass references, he's been putting together this rebuttal for a while it seems lol

Barkley is an easy target. But James really didn't respond to any of the thing Barkley actually said.
[Phil got popped by some stray shots lmao ](http://i.imgur.com/gZ6pYyl.jpg)
http://i.imgur.com/FH75Qje.jpg
Charles literally said "im not a role model, dont tell your kids to look up to me"So why is James comparing himself Lebron father of three James to Chuck anyways? Chuck dont give a shit
He's spot on. Chuck is so out of touch with whats going on in the league these days. To accuse Lebron of not wanting to compete is one of the dumbest things i've ever heard any analyst say across any sport.
That's not what Lebron's ripping Chuck for
To be honest this seems so petty from LeBron. Insult Barkley because he's hurt by what he said. Doesn't make Barkley's point any less valid though. LeBron needs to suck it up and play with what he has instead of bitching and complaining after every losing streak.
That's some petty shit talking about Chuck's money like that. I think that crosses a line. "You're poor, so I'm better than you."Everyone cites Chuck as being too generous and nice, and having issues with gambling.LeBron has made 4x the money Chuck did in the NBA, just the last 2 seasons add up to Chuck's career. It's not Chuck's fault dudes weren't paid as well back then.--As far as the character stuff, Barkley never hid it. He was honest and didn't give a fuck. That's fair to attack I guess, but being mad about that is like being mad that Rodman did some questionable things.LeBron should go host another special where he guts an entire state and not shake hands with a team, then snipe at his teammates on social media.
Barkley raised some really fair points and for lebron to come out like this is just so fucking petty.
Everyone here is praising LeBron for his savagery. Really? His comments were pathetic and out of line. Chuck gets paid to give his opinion on TV. LeBron didn't need to escalate it to personal attacks.
IT'S OVAH! IT'S OVAH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
Holy Shit. With no regard for CHUCK
damn that was straight savage, not even sure chuck can reply to that on tv atleast.
Shots fired. LeBron is frustrated from losing this month, understandable. Chuck did call James the best player in the world though. So not all hater
Wouldn't it be much worse if Chuck did all those things, then said "I am a role model"? At least Chuck knows he's a piece of shit. I don't know, it's a good rip but it just comes off really insecure and off topic.
This is the most candid Lebron has ever been. Never heard him like this in his whole career.
&gt;"I'm tired of biting my tongue," James said. "There's a new sheriff in town."I can't wait for all the LeSherriff memes
LeBron channeling his beloved Kendrick right there.
"I gotta bone to pick!" - Lebron James
he's been on point with his quotes since that was posted
I swear he read that post. Boy has been straight 🔥 ever since
Dude went from least quotable to most quotable in like a week!
I really think somebody linked that shit to him because he's been dropping gold on a biweekly basis since that post
LeBron is either the most quotable player or the least, and there is nowhere in the middle. He just has moods. He will sometimes be so incredibly open and talk about any topic (just last year: Reflecting on Kobe before playing him the final time or playing in the Kings' arena for the last time, which was the site of his first NBA game). Other times he's not, seems annoyed with having to do media and doesn't give anything. You just never know what to get with him. But he has always been capable of giving great quotes -- when he feels like it. He is 100 percent calculated
Lebron with the Clapback
They ripped into that guy in the actual thread
/r/nba didn't say that. Some rando dude who happened to be in /r/nba said that. You're acting like the subreddit has unanimously endorsed it
Nah. I love Lebron's quotes."Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi Leonard, he’s solid. He’s solid, solid at that end of the floor. He’s very, very solid. I like him. I like the kid."-LeBron James giving Kawhi Leonard a solid.Speaking of Kawhi and least quotable superstars...
"Im tired of biting my tongue. There's a new sheriff in town." As he put on his hat and left.I'm with him. Barkley is a clown dressed up for tv by tnt.
He is though. This is an exception, and Lebron says so himself
He is. But this was definitely fire. Good for him.
it's that time of year when he gets really testy
Can't wait for that LBJ mixtape this summer. &gt;The King&gt; Family Affair*cover photo of Bron holding a baby Steph*
Sounds like he did some research and wrote it three or four times before he liked how it sounded. Might as well make a bibliography also. Horny as fuck
for real. I agree with Barkley on his point that LeBron calls the shots on the Cavs, and that LBJ's recent comments do come across as somewhat whiny when looking at the big picture, but saying he doesn't want to compete is absurd.  this is straight heat from LeBron tho. fucking love the nba
i don't see it as whiny at all. it's one of the more stressful parts of the NBA season and things are together for bron. on top of that, all barkley does is rip on current players for doing the same shit he did, except in every situation he arguably acted worse. i see no issue with the shots lebron is throwing here bc they are all accurate.great player, funny dude, but barkley is hypocritical af
Flair checks out.

No you weren't, you were just waiting for him to do something for you to write this bullshit on reddit.

"TNT Halftime Show"
I like "Technical Foul"
"Days of our Flops"
T h i c c
I agree. Chuck is getting on Lebron about basketball. Lebron got salty and went the personal route. And none of which wasn't public knowledge or anything Chuck hasn't answered for. It's a solid roast, but I agree that it's weakened with this context.
Charles doesn't have 'Chosen 1' Inked on his skin
he fucking roasted him. Chuck is a massive hypocrite and lebron called him out on all his bullshit to show like "why would you ever listen to this guy"
So you are saying you only listen to morally superior players? Did you ever do stupid shit in your life that you grew beyond and matured over?If Barkley was pretending these things never happened, you might have a point, but Charles has taken all of this on the chest already. It's valid cause it's true, but calling him a hypocrite is to call him human. Charles walked a similar path twice as long as LeBron has, and this was just LeBron lashing out at the lowest hanging fruit. Bringing up the distant past as a judgment on today is never that accurate a criticism.
I feel like everyone who thinks this is a good burn are the youngings on here, it was an unnecessary attack on Charles personal life. He's fucked up plenty of times before but owns up to it.
&gt; He's fucked up plenty of times before but owns up to it.and it's all from like 10 years in the past where he was self-admittedly drinking more than he should have been. I get that Charles calling out LeBron's willingness to compete is a 'personal' attack, but it was still professional in nature. None of LeBron's attacks on Barkley were in regards to playing basketball - they were all in regard to his conduct off the floor.This is akin to me as a coworker complaining to management that you are not fully doing your responsibilities at your job and you responding that I once stole a sandwich out of the lunch fridge and got caught and reprimanded for it. It's unrelated. All LeBron has to do right now is put his head down and play good basketball.  Either that or he needs to 'tweak' his ankle in practice and take a week off. He's either gearing up for the playoff campaign right now by manufacturing some anger early, or he's spinning a bit in his perspective right now. The Cavs are a great team, and the fact is they chose JR Smith over Delly and they're regretting it now most likely. Maybe that was what LeBron originally wanted but Griff didn't want to pay Delly what he could get, and this is just the ultimate passive-aggressive LeBron laying down judgment because they ended up spending nearly twice as much on JR Smith instead. So he's probably frustrated by the comments two-fold because he WISHES he could be LeGM. If he was GM, they'd have made the right decisions in his mind (and maybe he's right).
&gt;"And if this makes him want to talk to me, the schedule's out there," James said. "He knows every road arena I'll be in. Don't just come up to me at All-Star and shake my hand and smile."They about to fight
After all these years, and that is still one of the best disses ever. TOP 5 on any day. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU)
Seriously. Lebron didn't say anything Chuck wouldn't say about himself. The criticism on Lebron is still valid.
What like asking for a backup pg? He didn't ask for Melo. Melo would already be on the team if he wanted Love gone. Also, he shouldn't have said anything to the media but he also said it to Griffin's face beforehand. Liggins and Felder aren't awful players, he just said that they can't depend on them in the playoffs and that's 100% true. Also saying that LeBron doesn't want to compete is complete bullshit if you ask me. There's evidence to back up him being competitive. All he cares about is winning championships.
The criticism is Lebron is eternally looking for more pieces instead of just grabbing the bull by the horns and getting it done with what he already has.  He's already got a way better team than many of the all-time greats had.  He needs to stop always trying to stack the deck and just play the cards he's been dealt.
he's deflecting, same thing he did when PJax took a dig at him.
Hell yes. Even in between games, the playes and the media are taking shots. NBA, where shading happens.
YOU CLAIM TO BE A BALLPLAYER BUT I FUCKED YOUR WIFE
I GOT 3 RINGS THE ONLY YOU GOT IS FROM YOUR WIFE
Delonte West special guest this week
It's not really about comparisons I don't think. I get the impression this is Lebron getting fed up with being criticized night in and night out without any chance to defend himself. I think he makes a pretty good point honesty.We have put the microscope so far up his ass at this point that we are just used to every step he takes being over analyzedEventually that will wear on anyone and Chuck defensively deserves to take a shot like that every once and a while. He sounds off on every player and while I do enjoy the man, hes essentially payed to stir up shit
Nah if Chuck wants to constantly come at the King, he'll come back at ya
Nah if Chuck wants to come at the king he best not miss

I'm telling you man. Rondo putting his STAR teammates on blast like that has opened up the floodgates for all these guys to attack each other in public.

And Curry is low key rounding into form.
It's dripping!
Shit is so fake though. I mean, I guess the response from Lebron is real, but the shit out Chunk's mouth certainly isn't. He's just another one of these jackasses that purposefully talks shit to bait these kinds of responses. This isn't real beef.
The NBA is a big juicy plum and after biting into it, the juices are running down mah chin.
NBA is basically soap operas for men
I've been distracted by all of the other political stuff going on. What else has been going on in r/nba lately? I need to know more.
thicc n juicy
"I never said I wasn't a role model," was super weird to throw in.  Chuck did all that shit, and *actually claimed* that you shouldn't do the shit he did, and Lebron *held that comment against him*?  That's like saying "He's so fat, and he said you shouldn't have a diet like him!"  Like the guy knows what he did wasn't right, and his advising your kids not to act in that way is constructive.  It really doesn't make sense to hold that advice against him
it's not a burn at all. none of the things listed are a secret or things that chuck denies. it's just who he is. he gets drunk, picks up 20-something college girls, gambles. chuck could really go off on lebron about the moral compass thing since lebron claims to be such a family man, but he won't.
&gt; chuck could really go off on lebron about the moral compass thing since lebron claims to be such a family man, but he won't.What exactly would he go off on him on that topic? Has LeBron not been a good family man?
Nice try Chuck...
Lol dude Bron roasted him regardless
Lebron read a wikipedia page about controversial Barkley incidents that happened while Lebron was in elementary school.  That's not a roast, that's a fucking history recital.
lol someones salty
...what?
&gt;"I know he wanted to retire a long time ago, but he can't," James said. "He's stuck up on that stage every week."&gt;James then issued a challenge, of sorts.&gt;"And if this makes him want to talk to me, the schedule's out there," James said. "He knows every road arena I'll be in. Don't just come up to me at All-Star and shake my hand and smile."God damn
Dont forget the [Eric Clapton Concert!](http://image.prntscr.com/image/0c77baa2444e495dabdb1bb5aa6c3913.png)
He did say "I'm not a role model" as a nod to Barkley in that commercial though
Seriously...Lebron wasn't even talking to me and my feelings were hurt.
Oh my god I can't believe this gift I have woken up to. This is going to lead to a seriously sobering Inside the NBA segment, I would imagine.
Notable that he could have said gotten a DUI while also getting caught getting a blowjob, so he did show some level of regard for human life..
That man has a family!
At least that makes one ring on his hands
Ah there it is. LeSavage. This is just cutting deep.
The drama is just getting started with this FIRE
What legacy?
I think now that Lebron's two sons is growing up, he wont let anybody disrespect his name.
rip chuck
Haha wow.
Should label that quote nsfl. Straight up murder.

Man how do you even respond to all that? Especially since LeBron never even mentioned Chuck's lack of rings.
Rekt level = 11

ehhh i'd honestly be pretty cool with everything on that list except for spitting on a kid and the unpaid debtchuck's legacy is renowned

I am not a big sports fan, but I am 100% a fan of the shade throwing going on  here.
Barkley threw a motherfucker threw a window and spit on a kid? What a fucking badass!
Damn Lebron did some research and shit. Probably has a list of citations and footnotes to hand out to the reporters.
What did he do to "disrespect his legacy"?
http://i.imgur.com/dXaHWjk.gif
I saw him throw that guy through a window. It was on church street in Orlando near a magic shop.

beat me to it...yeah charles barkley wasnt a very nice person back in the day
Moment of silence.
Wait, didn't lebron say he wasn't a role model in that commercial when he was in Miami? He was poking fun at Barkley then too but still...he did say it.
The fucking Alt-East. It's going to explode soon.
That's some heavy artillary
a little crazy, but that was Nike's marketing campaign, which paved the way for him to make a ton of money
But none of that bothers Barkley... That's precisely who Barkley *is* and it's the reason so many people love him. His passion and emotion are always just under the surface.James is a completely different guy, and for him to say he's never done the kinds of things Barkley did is just pointless. Barkley isn't in a contest with James to be a good role model, Barkley just thinks it's fucking ridiculous for a guy who has as much control over the team he plays for as James does to complain about lack of support from ownership/management. I happen to agree.
&gt;Threw somebody out a windowAh, I believe the correct term is "Defenestration", Mr. James.
I wanted medium rare, not burned to a fucking crisp.
&gt;I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' [Except he did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DccOb5sgBG0&amp;app=desktop)
His response was completely irrelevant to the points Barkley was making. Barkley was talking about purely on court issues he had about LeBron not being a competitor like he was and LeBron turned it around and made it personal. It makes LeBron seem like a petty bitch snapping back like that at any hint of criticism.
This seems like a major deflection to what Charles was criticizing him for though....unless I'm missing something this response is kind of over the top. That being said I welcome this beef, because hot damn.
Was that ever called into question though? Charles seems to be asking in an asshole way, why does LeBron need more?
Shots fired.
I've been a huge Lebron fan since his rookie year but this makes me lose all respect for him. Barkley constantly admits to his own flaws, and yet all Lebron is saying here is "I'm so great I'm so great I'm so great". Dude really needs an ego check.
Lebron has a point too. He's represented the game incredibly well for a guy who's been the face of the league for so long. Seems like a great person off the court.
This was the equivalent of killing a cockroach with a machine gun.
Chuck had good points. LeBron just getting defensive as fuck. He just lost to Dallas, sac, and New Orleans n he's extra sensitive right now. Bringing up personal shit in response to *basketball* criticisms is weak. Hope u keep losing u spoiled baby.
You come at the king, you'd best not miss.
Lebron still on that "Fuck u tour"
Holy shit Inside on Thursday is bout to be LIT
Attacking Charles' character doesn't change the fact that everything he has said still applies.
LBJ ran out of fucks to give, good on him.
shots fired...I dunno about anyone else, but I'm team Chuck on this one
Lebron is so soft. You say something like that when someone gets underneath your skin so bad you resort to starting a piss fight. In no way does this help your team or you. Just play ball baby, Barkley is not out on the court with you, focus on the game.
Hashtag team no snitch
Lebron is a snitch.  Snitches get stiches erneh. Barkley's going to put Bron in a body bag on inside the NBA
Everyone knows this. It isn't snitching.
He's a spineless snitch
Casual basketball watcher here, can somebody explain the significance of barlkley and Jordan laughing?
When LeBron went to Miami the first time to play with Wade and Bosh, Barkley and lots of other former players ran their mouths about how soft the kids were and how in their day they hated each other and wanted to win as individuals I walked uphill in the snow entitled millennial blah blah.  LBJ is pointing out that they were full of it.
GOODBYE **Politically-correct, say what people want to hear** LeBron. I love this and I still love Chuck
This is how Lebron starts to get revved up for the playoffs.
fuck yeah
[Pic of Barkley and Jordan were laughing](http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/18/dc/barkley-jordan-041615-ftrjpg_l9lxkuo5p5l81kksjbz4r2v14.jpg?t=-948170252)
Holy shit.  I vividly remember that scene with Barkley and MJ during a free throw.  I remember as a kid thinking it was weird for bald guys to rub heads the way they did.
Lebron quietly earning the fuck out of my respect like God damn...
You forgot the best part "There's a new sheriff in town."
It's only savage if Barkley is dead broke and is working to support himself. My guess: he's not. Barkley seems to me like the kind of guy who does/says whatever he wants, and the kind of guy who would love a job where he could, ohhh I dunno, maybe sit around and joke about basketball all day? He just thinks Lebron is being a little weird about this whole "I need more support from management."
It doesn't really answer Charles's critique though...
The really amazing thing is that Barkley got so far under LeBron's skin that LeBron actually took the time to do research on Barkley.He should be dealing with his team and its issues right now, but instead, he decided to have a quote-feud with a tv analyst.
Lol i dont think he did research, he talked shit about like the 3 most famous non basketball things chuck did
Well, Barkley thought the same thing I did.&gt; "I was laughing, clearly he did some homework ... he Googled me and found some things," Barkley said. "He was young when I was playing, so I appreciate that, but I'm not upset about it ... my criticism was fair and I'm good with that."
&gt;"He's stuck up on that stage every week."Man, that's a pretty fun place to be "stuck" on.
This is perfect, holy shit
I will upvote every god damn time
Straight up ad hominem. Rather than rebuke the claims he just talks shit.
Barkley talks plenty of shit about LeBron's character too.
Yup. Unfortunately, most NBA fans will deem it a burn or savagery. Yikes.
&gt;Never seen this level of savagery in a LeBron interviewHe's been bottling it up for 14 years.But seriousrly Lebron's squeaky clean image goes unnoticed. How many athletes are as popular and rich but haven't had a scandal. Shaq comes to mind.
IDGAF 'Bron activated. He ripped Phil, Chuck and all the old dudes who talk shit about how "tough" the league was back in the day. He went straight HAM!
He didn't even speak on what chuck was actually saying, and who cares what he says about phil? Phil has matched Lebrons career achievements (3 rings) 3 separate times in his life. Hes a shitty gm maybe
Shit charles needs a burn heal asap
He might also be referring to Barkley's previously stated goal of transitioning from TNT into being a GM.But because he is a laughingstock in many respects and Vlade's got the Sac job on lock, he's stuck as a talking head.
ERNEH!
Does Barkley have money issues?? I assumed he just wanted something to do. Seems like a sweet gig to keep a rich guy from getting bored
Barkley admitted having a gambling problem in 2006 and estimated at the time that he'd lost $10 million.  I would find it easy to believe he's lost more since then.
Yikes. I know I can't relate but.. You'd think if you had that much money you wouldn't need to gamble for more
Does Barkley have money issues?? I assumed he just wanted something to do. Seems like a sweet gig to keep a rich guy from getting bored
Ho. Ly. Shit.
Yea he is frustrated.  They'll get healthy and make a run I bet.
Barkley plays poker with Phil Hellmuth. That will make anyone go broke.
u mad bro?
CHILISH, ERNEH.
After coming back from the dead against the Warriors last year, everything is just an epilogue now. He's not taking anyone's crap any more
80s and 90s nba salaries were nowhere near today's levels. charles probably made 20-30M in salary total. not to mention that traveling the country getting paid to watch games now. tough life. i'd love to be that broke.

&gt;"I know he wanted to retire a long time ago but he can't," James said. "He's stuck up on that stage every week.""I collect one paycheck from this," James said of his role with the Cavs. "There's the owner, Griff's (David Griffin) the GM, I'm the player. Screw Charles Barkley."Barkley is still a millionaire lmao. Shaq is rich as fuck too. They could both quit whenever they want to.Lebron deflecting hard.
Check wil retire and we'll find in living under a bridge in days.
He just verbally raped Chuck.  One's ass can't recover from such a pounding.
http://i.imgur.com/R390EId.jpg
How much you wanna bet that this will lead to Chuck calling Kawhi the best in the world?
Yeah, he will not pick Steph or KD cause they play girly basketball
Isn't it funny how Chuck is one of the only few NBA analyst to pick the Cavs in the Finals last year, and now he is a hater? LeBron was throwing shade at organization's commitment to winning while they are paying the highest payroll in history and was losing money. If they did win last year, Dan Gilbert would be better off running an index fund than losing 40 millions.
Well he also isn't a fan of the Warriors "girly basketball" so that might be why he picked tha Cavs
What does  that last sentence mean?
It means he wanted to sound cool lolAnd also probably he's just gonna stop his whole nice guy act and call out the people who are constantly giving him crap
He should jump on the diss track Leveon Bell did towards Skip Bayless
This is so on point, with the pauses and everything
Your Barkley is not turrible.

LEAGUE DOUBLE FUCKED
Yeah, 14 years of having lesser people swing on your ballsack for everything you say or don't say, do or don't do, tell you how to behave, live your life, make decisions... all that finally culminating here.LeBron busted his ass on garbage teams for most of his career and did more with them than anyone in NBA history. LeBron had to pull out all-time great performances, time after time, out of his ass, while Bosh was struggling, or out with an injury, Wade was battling chronic knee injuries, the rest of the cast was old and not really good in Miami. He got to 4 straight Finals in 4 years and won two titles. Now he has to go against probably the toughest competition for a title ever in GSW + an underlooked Spurs team who would be a title favorite in 90% of other years, and he is getting shit on for wanting more competent players on his team? For what? Dude is fucking 32 years old with more mileage on his body than MJ after he retired the 2nd time on the Bulls, carrying an unprecedented load on his back in those years, and is now playing 38 mpg in his 14th season. Why?Now one will ever blame Love or especially Kyrie for being clearly worse players than they are. No, they will even say Kyrie is deservedly a starter in an All-Star game, or even the best PG in the league, that's how far they'll reach on the anti-LeBron movement, and they've been doing similar or worse reaches all his career. Meanwhile, there's a team with Curry, Durant, Green, Thompson, Iguodala and a solid cast outside of that waiting for the title to be handed to them, and you think LeBron is gonna sit quietly and watch that happen? He's not dumb, he knows they need more help to win the title, and doesn't give a fuck about Barkley's opinion on that, because Barkley's an idiotic hypocrite that's job is to stir shit up and whatever he says won't change anything about LeBron or the fact that Cavs indeed do need help to win the title. LeBron has no ego or pride issue. He'll say he needs help if he needs help. Doesn't make him lesser player, because he's not going 1v5 against an all-time great Warriors team and putting up 50/20/20. I know people want to see that, but let's stop living in ESPN-enforced fairytale narratives and start looking at reality, shall we?I'm not LeBron's bitch by any means, but even I'm starting to get tired of defending the guy against idiotic accusations his whole career. Glad he's finally decided to stand up for himself.
Villain lebron is back baby
We need the mask
He's already made so many LeFuckYou 3's this season. He probably just decided to step it up and go for a LeFuckYou Chuck.
kneel and kiss the motherfucking rings
I actually thought Kenny made the same remarks, I don't know why Lebron only went after chuck.
Likely because every time something comes up with him, Chuck is always anti-LeBron.
This is Trump's America
I've seen him act really cold/toxic to David Blatt thoughOh, and he shoulder checked Erik Spoelstra
I really doubt Charles responds to this, LeBron got really personal. And he's right Charles has done some terrible things in his life
The setup is gonna be brutal.  Shaq and Kenny are going to be laughing and interrupting making fun of chuck so hard whenever Chuck tries to start his response monologue.  It's gonna take a good 2 minutes at least for Charles to get silence in the studio, ha.  Can't wait.
Turner sports? FUCK YOU TOOTNT? FUCK YOU TOOKENNY the jet SMITH? FUCK YOU TOO!Ted turner, FUCK YOU TOO

The best part about this is that LeBron went out of his way to shit on Phil Jackson once again.
Yeah he faces some criticism and suddenly the real LeBron comes out. Amazing player, possibly the GOAT, but huge douchebag with a fake media presence.
I uploaded this meme yesterday that I made because I was so satisfied by the recent Garnett retaliation when Barkley insulted him about Hall of Fame. So crazy to wake up and see Lebron now firing back at ol' Chuck.

This isn't genuine drama lol.
Thanks for explaining why lol.
12-track concept album with Le'Veon Bell and Aaron Rodgers.
I don't think there was ever a bridge to Phil Jackson. Lebron clearly felt slighted by Phil and decided to take it out with the 'posse' story. When Phil ignored him, Phil was doing his job. If you want to talk to someone go introduce yourself.
Lebron is essentially a super human.  There is nothing you can truly criticize him about.  He can crush anyone in a public beef.  What is the worst you can say about him?  And this is coming from a Lebron hater.
The worst people can come up with is the Decision and even that raised millions for charity.
Poor idea for a PR stunt. Made him look like a attention hungry douche but that's the PR guys' fault.
Active Aggressive LeBron
[deleted]
On that Drake over Meek Mill "Back to Back" level for sure
Except LeBron said his own words.
Good one
Lebron is smart enough to know Skip just says things because he knows it will rile people up.He knows the difference between that and someone giving their actual opinion.Besides, they're both Cowboys fans. They're secretly brothers.
The Clapback LeBron.
aggressive aggressive Lebron
Oh daaaaaamn.
we'd have to see them lose to the nets in order for lebron to let that one out
It's because they lost to the Mavs FTM.
He's saving that for his Hall of Fame speech.
yeah lmao did you see that clip of him mocking lebron by whining and crying that he needs more help? Lebron would absolutely shred that mofo
JR or Danhtay can do the roast on Skip
Everyone knows that Skip does what he does for the ratings, Chuck actually believes what he's sayng.
Would love for him to destroy Skip like Sherman and Cuban in the past.
Literally what is there to even say about Skip?  Skip Bayless and LeBron James aren't even from the same terrestrial realm.
Aggressive Lebron is terrifying.  See: 2007 ECF :(

The whole time I was reading it i kept scrolling to the top to make sure I wasn't on the onion or something. Unbelievable
LeBron doesn't burn bridges. You burn bridges with LeBron
Nah Chuck will make a comment about how the Warriors won't win the title and all the Cavs fans will be back on board with him.
LeBron is the bridge.  He don't need nothing from no one in the NBA.
I have a feeling that Lebron has been holding all of this in side for many years so he decided to let it all out at once.
More aggressive defensive LeBron. Instead of defending his reasoning for trading for more 'play-makers', he straight up at Chuck, deserving so.
What did he do to "disrespect his legacy"?
WWE does 😏
*remembers Roman coming out at #30* nah, I'll stick to basketball

Literally could have been anyone else. Angle, Joe, Shinsuke, Finn Balor, shit even AJ Styles could have walked out as 30 since he dropped the title earlier that night.But nooooo it had to be him. Not like he was heavily involved in the past 2 Royal Rumbles or anything /s

Reeee
It is though.
It's been a great week or so for the NBA in terms of drama.The Bulls circus, McCollum dropping Parsons, and now this?Great time for us.
Don't forget reliable Matt Barnes!
I think Lebron considers attacks on his competitive spirit as essentially equivalent to ad hominem attacks: the reason that Barkley hasn't stated anything similar to what Lebron said is because there's nothing to really say. Lebron's a great guy off the court and he HAS been an excellent ambassador for the game. Very little time is spent mentioning that, and instead his detractors try to turn him into a caricature of himself. It probably pisses him off. Granted Lebron must be pretty stressed out to go this ham, and this seems out of the ordinary. I think Barkley is bearing the brunt of a lot of his frustrations because he landed hits on Lebron relatively recently. I don't think that's fair.
Have to agree with this. At first I was like "holy shit, Lebron went off," but now it seems to me that this the same petty behavior that characterizes Lebron. He went on an ad hominem rant on a, frankly, easy target and overstepped the boundaries of the arena which this occurred.
Someone obviously doesn't watch Fraudiola post-match interviews
An average Mourinho interview generates much more personal shit than this
lebron is a sensitive ass baby back bitch
Ah I get it. Mothafuckas can sit there and talk about you on tv but LeBron can't say shit back. You sound like the sensitive one.
That's what I'm saying. We expect athletes to just be okay with critics and analysts just constantly shitting on them all day. Everyone's human, getting told you're not trying hard enough or that you're whiny is gonna piss you off after some point in time.
I mean, it's one thing if Charles' original comments on LeBron recently were uncalled for. I completely disagree with that, so I think this response by LeBron is stupid and doesn't respond to the criticism. Barkley's point was that LeBron was whining to the media about how his team wasn't enough of a super team and put some of the blame on the organization. If LeBron never made public comments about how his team isn't good enough because of the young guys and how they really need a veteran playmaker PG but the front office didn't bring that type of player in, nobody would have said shit about LeBron. He brought this on himself. I'm all for defending athletes from the media when they get bullshit criticism, like Colin Cowherd criticizing Wall's lack of leadership because he didn't have a father growing up, but not when they bring it on themselves. If you decide to air some dirty laundry about your team, it's fair game to expect criticism. LeBron didn't even respond to that criticism of his public whining about his team not having the final piece it needs, he just deflected and made this a point about Chuck's personal life.
I don't care about this incident but Lebron is a giant pussy imo
Careful he's a man and a father of three and he'll let you know that.
Dude has faced down ridiculous expectations and overcome every challenge placed in front of him. He's a physical bully and resilient to injury. I just don't see it.
Why couldn't Lebron construct an argument against what Barkley said? Responding fairly is one thing, Lebron didnt.
I have no problem with Lebron saying shit back but this kind of response is weak as fuck. If he's going to respond, how about actually respond to what Chuck was saying. He's literally avoiding every point Chuck made. He attacks a bunch of random character stuff that has nothing to do with the initial comments.
It's called dealing with the criticism that comes with fame and stardom. At a certain point, it doesn't do any good to reply to verbal jabs; it makes him look petty. Especially with ad hominem attacks. Look at Donny, motherfucker's the leader of the free world and still tweets out insults to people who go on TV and dare question his policies.
Lmao you're comparing LeBron James to Donald Trump?
That's unpresidented!
ugh.
Alright, if that comparison doesn't sit with you, say Ben Affleck during an interview ranted about how movie critics kept shitting on Gigli when it came out. Still looks petty as fuck.
&gt; At a certain point, it doesn't do any good to reply to verbal jabs; it makes him look pettyIf this was someone who did it constantly and was always running their mouth, sure.The reason this is blowing up is precisely because it is LeBron, who doesn't get in the dirt.  It's because we know he't not (publically) petty about this shit that makes this a big deal.
Lol yeah because he should just take what Charles Barkley said right? There are consequences for talking shit. I know sometimes internet commenting can remove us from that reality. If you take shots at someone you had better expect them to fire back.
Really? Cause it took him 14 years to react like this. That's not something g a sensitive person does.
Does LeBron have to be watching to hear what Charles said about him? Also, just because Charles is giving his opinion on tv doesn't mean players can't get offended and respond. He called LeBron whiny and said he doesn't want to compete. I don't think LeBron should have brought up Charles' past but he wasn't too far out of line.
I think Barkley straight-up struck a nerve without intending too. I'm sure Lebron is his own worst critic.
Anyone who reaches that level of greatness most likely is
Clearly you don't watch football (soccer).
Finals that don't live up to the hype &amp; passive-aggressive media bitching isn't all that dramatic.
Are you joking?
No, not compared the NBA.
not to mention the guy who is his idol and who's legacy he is chasing after did all that same shit. Jordan was notorious for never sleeping, drinking, and gambling his ass off all while being the greatest player of all time.  I'm sorry but these comments just reconfirm that he can't handle anything other than being liked accross the board.I think Chuck's criticisms were totally fair. He constantly recognizes that Lebron is the best player but points out things that he doesn't agree with. It's really that simple. Also, "What makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV?".... no, I'm pretty sure it's his hall of fame career that makes him credible.
Bruh "mee ohh my" gets me every time
BOOMSHAKALAKA
You must not follow football (soccer).
BINGO
OH WHAT A MONSTER JAM BY LEBRON JAMES
Lebron stans haven't had much going for them recently. Let them have their fun.
I'm not a Stan but I'm still a fan and I believe it was too much. Yeah I get that Chuck isn't right but fuck man, you got to be a bit better than that. There are times when neither side is right and this is one of those.
true, neither side is right. But the Cavs fans are out in full force saying "OMG LEBRON A SAVAGE BRUH LMAO BARKLEY GOT SHUT THE HELL DOWN"
The Mavs have a way to make Lebron grow up and evolve.
Underdog, put that on a t-shirt!
This reaction is kinda like when you're losing by 15 in 2k to someone you shouldn't be losing to, and then some guy in the back keeps talking shit and laughing at you.
Mike Breen: [BANG]
Yea his answers and press conferences are usually pretty boring/canned answered/say nothing while saying something but this is as real as it gets.
I wish the NHL had more marketable players and juiciness. All we get is a player crashing into a tim hortons while drunk or getting arrested because he likes to party.
Absolutely.
Amy word when DDR plays?
So because Chuckie gets paid to talk shit Lebron doesn't get to talk shit back for free? Fuck that
I kind of agree, but I'm completely fine with it because it serves as great entertainment for me.
My man LeBron just Called Charles a Broke Boi... Wow
Truth hurts
It made me think less of Lebron to be honest. He gets accused of whining and goes on an epic whine rant. Just so childish of him.
it makes lebron look like a little bitch... again. go out and play ball. ignore the talking heads. they're not the reason you're losing right now, and you damn well know he wouldn't have said this is they were on a 10 game win streak.
&gt; If Lebron doesn't like it, turn off the TV. Except he gets asked questions about what Barkley says by reporters as part of his job.
I completely agree with you. I understand why LeBron is upset, but instead of responding to the criticism, he just personally attacked Charles Barkley. It almost sounds like LeBron did research on Charles Barkley's past just so he could list all the bad things Barkley has done to make him look as bad as possible.
probably that 7-8 record in january
I like to think Lebron purposely does stuff like this to be the villain and make the NBA more entertaining
Well Charles attacking Lebron's competitiveness probably feels like he is attacking his character to Lebron. Basketball is a massive part of who he is and saying he isn't competitive might feel like an attack on his character. Lebron also obviously had a lot of this stuff pent up for a while
Didn't he give his thoughts on it a short while ago? He was significantly more civil when talking about "Chuck is on TV, he is paid to increase ratings" and so forth. I have to assume he's been stewing on this issue.
I agree with you - this was a cheap shot by Lebron.
I agree, LeBron just being a whiny champ
Ya I just commented the same thing. People are so caught up in the "woah savage!!" aspect of this that barely anyone is pointing out that this is glaring ad hominem arguing. He just attacks a bunch of shit that has nothing to do with Barkley's initial point
I agree, he comes across as a petulent child.The best player in the world and the leader of the team. "Blames" the ownership and bottom half of the roster when he isn't putting in the necessary effort himself (not yet, anyway). He should've expected some backlash, those were stupid and unnecessary comments to make in public. To lash out with personal attacks when called out as such is extremely immature.
Just because Lebron gets a paycheck to play basketball doesn't mean he isn't allowed an opinion too, right?There's no arguing that what was said by Lebron was personal, and also mean. But regardless of who you support in this beef, they both have a right to say whatever they want, subject to the consequences.  And no, he doesn't need to turn off his TV, any more than you need to just ignore the dude at the other cubicle who shouts annoying or rude shit to you every day. I bet you say something to him, and I bet after a while you don't show a lot of restraint.They don't like each other, and the media specifically sets it up so that they can, if they choose, speak their mind.
But to be a top sports *celebrity*, you're personal life has to be as good as your professional. Bringing up dirt that is known about a player, like spitting on people or gambling, is fair game.
Lebron is the best and you are not. Snowflake.
Lebron also gets paid to be on TV and do interviews, so what's your point? That's part of his job too and he can say what he likes to the people who get paid to talk about him all day. There are plenty of things Charles Barkley could say other than talking shit about Lebron's character when he himself has no moral ground to stand on.
Nah, people were going open season on LeBron because they knew he wouldn't respond. Now some might come at him for clicks, but most know he ain't one to trifle with.
Just because you're on TV and paid to give opinions doesn't exempt you from criticism. Chuck is free to say whatever he wants, which often includes personal criticism. LeBron is also free to strike back.
Yeah, normally they poke mouses/rats with a stick and it never fights back, you poke an alpha wolf you risk the likelihood of getting destroyed.
Im with you man. LeBron is acting like a child.
Totally agree - as soon as i saw it - i just said "this is just unneccesary and out of context". Not sure what's up with lebron.
NBA is now more than ever the male soap opera.Lebron vs Phil got the ball rolling. I didn't think we'd top the Chicago mess this season, and we didn't even get a week.I wonder what will be next. Boogie has been teasing us for years now, but can't make that next step that brings the real drama.
And he should just sit there and take it. Stay in line right? Chuck has been talking shit for a while and has cast aspersion on Bron before. He had it coming.
MMA bruh. The drama is next level
I can't wait for the offseason when Lebron is locked in his house with all his buds while Chuck is driving around trying to find him and not being able to get him to answer his phone. According to "sources" of course.
"If you don't like that, you don't like nba basketball!"
So he's not allowed to respond to criticism? You sound like a whiny bitch
did he even respond to the criticism, or did he just trash Chuck?
Read the article. He responded to his criticism
Barkley's issue is that Lebron is whining to the media that his team's roster is constructed poorly when Lebron had a hand in constructing it.Lebron's responses consisted of:ad hominem attacks on Barkleyand citing his own legacyall of those are true, but did he respond to anything involving his complaining to the media or his hypocrisy with the largest payroll in the league? No he didn't.Chuck is a hypocrite but that doesn't make his comments any less true.Lebron should be able to respond to criticism, but at least address the *real issue* if you wanna trash talk too.
Yup. Charles critiques Lebron as a player but Lebron thinks it's ok to attack him as a person?
LeBron really didn't have an answer so he just started attacking Chuck personally.LeBron really is the king, at deflecting.
I disagree.  If someone talks shit about you, you should be able to fire back.  Simple as that.
But muh roasts
Bitchy quotes to the media &amp; sub-par finals, sounds great.
He mad.
is he stressed tho
Lebron must be one of the most whiniest entitled bitchass superstar out there. Everything has to go his way and when people comment on it he has to make it personal. Chuck was right. You can reply that chuck is a shit analyst. No need to bring his personal issues into it. When they called you soft bitch in the finals, you almost cried because you a father, a husband and a MAN. Sure you just a bitch as a player. Now you start to make it personal ? Damn that is fucking low. He acts like he is a fucking saint. How about you talk on how you left Cleveland to make a superteam and chase rings? Talk about how you left Miami when your team got utterly destroyed? You just take the easy route superstar.When the going gets tuff, who is out there working on the solution? Not Lebron, because he gets pouty on defense and refuses to play decent and just sends cryptic tweets into the world about his teammates and how they should pick it up. Sure lebron. You aint done nothing wrong, you a fucking saint. His talent is amazing, but his personality as a player is horrible.Not juding him for his outside the court and at home personality, just his basketbalpersona.
lol lebron fans down voting you for the truth
Thanks. I don't really care about the downvoting.I can respect Lebrons talents on the court if he brings it. It's just that his demeanor and his overall persona surounding that is that of a whiny spoiled girl when she doens't get what she wants.
100% truth.
&gt; When they called you soft bitch in the finals, you ~~almost cried because you a father, a husband and a MAN~~ posted back-to-back 40+ point games, followed by a triple-double to make history as the first team to come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals. All against the best regular season team in history.FTFYNice hot take tho!EDIT: formatting
He did first cry about how they called him a little bitch and said that he was a father of 3 and a man.Like I said nothing against Leflop as a player. His talent and skills are amazing. Just his demeanor and persona are that of a entitled princess.
that was great until the last line, "there's a new sheriff in town." and he's lame again
He probably thought that would be a great closing line when he was planning what to say, like dropping the hammer down lol
tbh, everything he said prior to the that line did not make me think he was a sheriff at all.
Damn.  Looks like LeBron got his feelings hurt.  Way to go all ad hominem against Charles Barkley.  How about you actually address the points Barkley brought up, "King" James.
but did barkley ever shit on his teammates ?
He went overboard with what he said about Barkley.It was way too personal and unnecessary.Chuck was criticizing him from a basketball perspective,yet he's bringing up Vegas debts,spiting on kids,long forgotten incidents smh...I guess the truth hurts,Chuck is the only one with guts in the media to have called LeBron out on this matter.Whining about his roster in a bum ass cakewalk conference.Come on man,you guys are the defending champs and you are supposed to be the best,the most competitive player out there,yet all you do is whine lately.Your team spends the most money on salaries and it's not even close.Everything was done to put you in the best possible position to win. This season aswell,all the people you wanted were resigned,Korver was brought in for peanuts,you are earning even more cash and so on....I think the board will succumb eventually and they'll pull of some backup pg heist to satisfy James,but boy has he painted a bad picture about himself lately.
Like Chuck doesn't constantly joke about his past transgressions all the time
Huge difference. You jokingly saying your son got the bad end of the stick looks wise is different from your friend agreering and saying "yeah he's an ugly bastard".Its different.
LeBurnnnn James
It was going so well, until the sheriff thing...
**DOWN GOES BARKLEY!** #DOWN GOES BARKLEY!!!
This is like a John Cena heel turn
He's made it far enough to where he can look back at most of the greats and say, "yes, I am that much better than you" . fools better recognize
Charles "Jebaited" Barkley.
This is why I love the NBA.  Even the off court drama is entertaining (as long as its not my team).
LeBron is butthurt because KD and the Warriors are coming along stealing his super team swag and making it harder for him to get rings so he can just retire already and get on with his acting and entrepenurial career.
Add LeBron to the KG and Shaq list of dudes who have torn Barkley up this year
why isn't there vid of this interview?
Wtf what did chuck say that made Lebron get so saucy lmao
chuck called him out for saying the cavs need a playmaker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enCBX1RusRk
LeSavage
Does anyone know what Charles Barkley said?
Questioned his competitiveness and will to win as an athlete. Called him a whiner who has more than enough on his squad to win
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enCBX1RusRk
lol
Say what you will about LeBron when he's on the court but the man has displayed pure class outside of it ever since coming into the league. When the biggest controversy surrounding you is "The Decision" then you've done a mighty job of being a respected role model that kids can look up to.He's accepted a long time ago that he's a role model for millions of children around the world and has done an incredible job doing it.
Not a LBJ fan, but I will never deny this.
there is no refuting that.
Oh shit! Who does the Cavs play next?
You know its real when Charles Oakley gets involved http://popgates.com/charles-oakley-shots-fired/
GAH-DAMMM!!!!
So LeBron expects a pat on the back for staying out of trouble? Wow. He is so fucking pathetic. Came into the league with an ego the size of his giant growth hormone jaw. He is the biggest whiner in the league.
Barkley sits on there talking his shit and hot takes all the time, probably not expecting anything back from the players, but it's no secret LeBron cares about his reputation and legacy and what he said is completely fair. He should hold this one because LeBron completely destroyed him
Except he didn't really address *any* of the points Chuck made, if anything he confirmed Chuck's points. Everything LeBron said is true but it doesn't really have anything to do with what Chuck said..
Lebron is right. Barkley was one of the best players of his era, but he should shut up, Lebron is way better than him and would have dominated Barkley's era easily if Mike wasn't present.
Dafuq, his job at TNT is literally to talk about the NBA. Charles Barkley fucking praised him a lot. He always said he's "never seen a player like LeBron", whenever LeBron comes up. How Cavs have no chance if LeBron wasn't there, how LeBron is the one that makes the Cavs click.One criticism on LeBron wanting more, even though they're defending champs with the highest payroll, LeBron resorts to irrelevant personal insults. That means it's fair game now for anyone to keep bringing up "The Decision", Mavs 2011, LeCramp and all that bullshit.
Sir Charles is right. How do you run to the media to cry about needing more? Stop being whiny and play the game you are the best player in the NBA
Finally. An unfiltered LeBron. This dude has had to deal with ridicule and criticism for 14 years since he was drafted back in 03, more than any basketball player has EVER had to endure in their career. Time and time again he’s proven himself and shown that he’s one of the best the league has seen, never been in any off the court issues, never involved in any scandals, great role model, sends thousands of kids to college, gives to charities, a down to earth family man. Yet people continue to hate on him cause why? Yet these NBA “greats” like Barkley still continue to discredit him when he say things like needing a backup PG and blow it out proportion by saying “he wants all these superstars”, “he isn’t competitive” etc. If I was LeBron I would’ve spoken my mind sooner. You expect a guy to just sit there and take it all in while you drag his name through the mud? So Charles can say what he wants about LeBron but LeBron can’t hit some truth right back at him? Nah go ahead, speak your mind man. Hope more NBA players follow suit
lebron did the same kind of shit last year to take pressure off the cavs when they were struggling and trying to meshthink chuck just provided a convenient outlet for him to get attention onto himself and off the team
Wtf I love LeBron now
**LeAngry James** we welcome you into our locker room
Lebrony.. Your team lost more money than they spent on you.. just to win a championship.. time to STFU.. you entitled shit stain.
James made good points but he lost me at this quote "Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then."  Barkley and Jordan did not team up with each other in their primes to over power the rest of the nba. Lebron did what he did to win his first championship. He need to except the critisism he gets for going to the heat because it was a cheesy thing to do. It was also the smart thing to do.
I think he was referring to the criticism from old timers that this generation is too friendly with each other. Not the Heat thing specifically. You have a point, though.
Except the old dogs always make sure to let everyone know, how players are laughing and joking and are generally too friendly to each other (and are, hence, less competitive), while back in the day, everyone hated each other and wanted to beat each other up. I think that's what Bron was alluding to..
The one thing I never got about this argument was the fact that lebron and wade weren't really rivals even if they were in the eastern conference together since Cleveland only become a proper title contender after the heat had already won, and after their victory they never even made it to the second round or faced the Cavs while lebron was there. Same goes for Toronto and Bosh. Barkley and Jordan joining forces would have be been completely different
I really think people felt the need to go out of their way to act like it was more unprecedented than it was. The goalposts moved all the time. "A reigning MVP has never switched teams." Moses Malone did. "Well not to join up with another top five player." Uhh Julius Erving? "Well he didn't do it on live TV." Okay.
they were all allstars from the same draft class (one of the greatest draft classes of all time)  they were rivals. At that time it still could be argued that wade was better than Lebron since wade won a ring in 06.  Instead of continuing to compete against each other they joined up and made a super team.  It worked out for all of them, but it still was a cheesy thing to do. Especially since they did it durring their basketball prime Lebron was liek 25/26 when he went to the heat.
I mean I admittedly didn't follow the NBA as much in the mid 2000s but having read a lot of old articles - I.e bill Simmons trade values from 2000-2016 and wade and lebron never seemed to be properly considered in the same tier especially 2007 onwards when lebron truly came into his own and Wades injuries started to kick in. Anyway yeah 3 all stars joining up like they did definitely isn't the best way to go about winning a ring, I just think it often gets overstated
Wade is considered by most to be the third best shooting guard of all time behind only Jordan and Kobe. and if it wasnt for the injuries maybe he would be higher. The criticism is not exaggerated Lebron teaming up with Wade and Chris bosh a multiple all star was cheesy and Lebron is still using the same formula on the cavs he traded in wade and bosh for younger counter parts wade(irving) bosh(Love). I feel that this super team is a key factor why Kevin Durant joined the warriors. Every Lebron super team has dominated the east since the 2010-2011 season.
As I said, I do agree with you to an extent, just saying when you or other people compare it to 'Barkley and Jordan teaming up' is what I take issue with. What he did is nowhere near as bad as that.
[deleted]
Name one good point he made. None of this was about Chuck. He didn't respond to a single criticism Chuck made. Classic ad hominem start to finish. Only made it look like LeBron *has no* actual rebuttal to anything Chuck said. It's like someone telling you there's a green thing in your teeth. Then instead of looking in the mirror and picking it out, you just shout 'FUCK YOU' and punch the person who told you. Well, too bad, because you still have a green thing in your teeth.
Wow. He even went in on chuck, personally. Goddamn...
Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith have gone after his hairline though.
His hairline is free game! Even lebron, himself makes fun of it, lol
Yeah true, I was kidding.
"im not a role model" chuck was never dishonest about himself. he never claimed to be anything more then who he is.
Like that was such a bad thing to say.  Chuck kept it fucking real
TBF Lebron never claim anything more than who he is either. He is still the father of 3 children
&gt; "They (CLE) have given him everything he wanted. They have the highest payroll in NBA history. He wanted J.R. Smith last summer, they paid him. He wanted Shumpert last summer. They brought in Kyle Korver. He's the best player in the world. Does he want all of the good players? He don't want to compete? He is an amazing player. They're the defending champs."I thought Barkley actually had some good points here. But damn, Lebron came at him hard. To be fair he didn't really respond to any of Barkley's points. But in a way he did point out that he falls under way more scrutiny than other players.
That's all chuck said?? I thought there would be more to it
LeQuotable
Late comment so I think this will get buried but, in my opinion, LeBron is using this moment and criticism from Charles to turn the tables and change the narrative around just like he did with Phil Jackson's comments. Phil Jackson said "posse", not to be racist, but just mentioning LeBron's close, childhood friends who he wanted to spend time with on a road trip when playing with Miami. LeBrin changed that narrative from him being a needy, diva-like star, to Phil Jackson possibly being racist because he used the word "posse". In this case, Charles is criticizing LeBron for the criticism he hears LeBron giving the Cavs front office. They just won the championship, so as Charles said on Inside, he doesn't see why LeBron needs to "whine and complain" about not having another playmaker. Yes, the Warriors added Durant, but I think Chuck's point is that the defending champs should expect to take on all challengers, especially the teams that react to the champs by building a roster to overcome the champs (like Golden State did in the summer). LeBron has now turned this narrative from being a passive-aggressive, whiny star player who makes these crazy, non-stop roster demands despite how much has been spent on the roster already, to the fact that he's not a bad guy because he hasn't done all the things he listed that Chuck did during his own playing career. Charles made some huge mistakes and did not come off as well as LeBron has these past 14 years yes, but Charles never pretended to be anyone other than himself, good or bad. This was never about LeBron being a bad person, because he is not. However, as a super star, he is incredibly whiny, passive aggressive, and sometimes cares too much about public narrative and public perception of him. So he makes a statement yet again that trashes the person who is criticizing him so he can avoid any backlash or anyone truly contemplating how he does things.
I agree with just about everything you said. LeBron changed the narrative from being about his character as a basketball player to his character as a human being. He definitely seems like a great person off the court -- i don't think anyone can really dispute that.I don't know whether this is all intentional or if he's just had enough with Chuck and letting off some steam, but either way it'll probably have the same outcome. With that said, there's definitely a part of me that gets a little satisfaction from someone firing back at Barkley because that guy can be an irrational hater at times.
yep. pretty much this.
LeBron is corny as fuck lmao "theres a new sheriff in town" who even says that in real life seriously.  I already know on Thursday its gonna be Ernie bringing it up like, "Chuck did you pay attention to the news this week?  The King had a few choice words for you" *reads LeBrons comments* "So Chuck anything to say on that?" *Chuck stuttering* "Ernie Listen.." Shaq and Kenny gonna butt in and instigate and be like "uh oh chuck the King coming at your rack!" and Chuck is either gonna be laughing like "cmon lebron you know we love you man" or be super serious and be like "listen lebron james i got nothing but respect for lebron james hes the best basketball player in the world, but I still stand by what I said etc..."
He's a big Walking Dead fan...
Charles not being a good role model doesn't change the fact that Lebron is a whiner.
Barkley is 100% right about all he has said. Lebron is such a baby.
LeBron might be the most insecure professional athlete ever. For someone that worries nonstop about his legacy, he does more damage to it than anyone else just spouting garbage ever could.
And here...we...go.
Oh damn. LeBron is talkin spicy.
Looks like someone got a little triggered.
LeBron is very good at this shit. He hits back for the second time this season but doesn't talk about what Charles or Phil actually said.
LeBron leads the league in deflections this season
I can't remember a 10-day stretch in the NBA that has produced this much drama across the league. I LOVE IT!
[Charles Barkley rn](http://wonderpodonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/charles-barkley.jpg)
LeBron getting defensive and taking it straight to the media. You know the end is close. Yes he's had a clean career, but you never know what lies in the basement.
how is this an indication of that in any way lmao
Chuck's criticisms doesn't warrant that personal of a response from LeBron IMO. Watch the segment again. Nothing Chuck said was THAT mean spirited. The best playmaker in the league is asking for another playmaker?I hope Chuck just laughs this off on the show. Old man Chuck don't give a fuck. He called out MJ as a bad owner with a bunch of yes men. He'll call out anybody.
Yeah, because Bron and Kyrie shouldn't be playing 40 minutes in every regular season game. There is no backup PG.
I believe this was just the final straw that broke the back
It defies me how some people can still defend LeBron as a person. He's an excellent player, a choker, but an excellent player. It's just that the stuff he says beside the court are just plain stupid or driven by base motives. Seriously, how insecure can you be? He's essentially a megastar who makes millions every year, but still needs to whine and bitch about every little thing someone says about him.
Who else has he ripped into like this? Hes very passive aggressive about the media. Choker? The man just came back from a 3 1 deficit to lead his team to their 1st chip in decades. Hes been to the finals numerous times and its not likes hes the only player on the team so youre bound to lose. Hell All of the superstars in the league today are chokers could none of their success measures up to James.
IMO this just shows how mentally weak this dude is, he seems obsessed with his public image. Must be really tough for him not being top 5 all time (MJ, WC, Magic, Kareem, Kobe) after his career is over. Plus he is barking up the wrong tree, if Charles was still playing he would not only step over him, but stomp his face on the way. Fucking sissy ball nowadays.
Charles can be annoying, but Lebron does whine a lot, on court and off court. Also he was questioning Lebron's competitiveness. If Lebron's going to complain and air out all the cavs issues, throwing his fellow teammates under the bus, what's wrong with Charles just doing his job?
Selfish and entitled LeBron James fires a whiny rebuttal while not disputing any of the points chuck made and going for personal attacks instead. Typical.
It's too late for this
LeBron's getting tough trying to rile up this Cleveland squad
LeBron is probably super pissed about how the Cavs have been playing lately, and it probably felt good to blow off some steam.
LeEther
LeSalty
Wow, this makes me really like LeBron... puts things into perspective. Of course he isn't perfect, but damn, hes a pretty alright guy for someone in his position.
Can't wait for Thursday. Chuck's gonna chuck.
I hope this has the same effect of when Klay said: ''I guess he just got his feelings hurt'' and Lebron responded by laughing in the media session and proceeded to drop 41 on their ass twice.
Barkley is an asshole. Always has been, always will be.
Way to take the "high road", thin skinned bitch.Sorry, rings don't count when your personality sucks.  Barkley's the man !"I'm not going to let him disrespect my **LEGACY** !  Of crying about calls and half earning your rings, yeah a lot to disrespect there. GET EM Charles !
Rings don't count when your personality sucks? LMAO
While everything LeBron said was true, he never really addressed what Chuck's criticism was. This was an ad hominem attack to deflect. But damn, I've never heard LeBron come at people like this.
I wish Charles Barkley had a Twitter account.
Wow I thought this was typical sensationalist headline bullshit until I actually read the article.Lebron just delivered a straight-up personal ~~attack~~ annihilation.
Bron Bron with the truth bombs yeeesh
Lebron is right on with his roast but Chuck is 100% on his opinion about LBJ. "Inappropriate. Whiny. All of the above," Barkley said of James last week. "The Cleveland Cavaliers, they have given him everything he wanted. They have the highest payroll in NBA history. He wanted J.R. Smith last summer, they paid him. He wanted [Iman] Shumpert last summer. They brought in Kyle Korver. He's the best player in the world. Does he want all of the good players? He don't want to compete? He is an amazing player. They're the defending champs."
This is the lebron I like. He tries too hard to be nice to everyone all the time
God damn I wish they woulda saved this drama for F5 season - this is prime reading material right here
What is with the savagery in the NBA these past few weeks
Where was this lebron all along. This stuff makes me like him.
Anyone else think it's lame when players glaring up their own legacy.
Do you think that as Lebron was getting into his car, he was like, "crap, that sheriff line was corny."
barkley wasnt wrong still
New [sheriff](https://blog-blogmediainc.netdna-ssl.com/upload/SportsBlogcom/2472067/0187088001437665004_filepicker.jpg) in town
Angry lebron is best lebron. Can't wait to see what he does on the court.
Lebron with the CM Punk level pipebomb, my god!
I like both guys and I love this shit haha.
So what did Barkley say about James..??
Let me guess, Barkley is racist now?
SIT DOWN, CHUCK, YOU FAT MOTHERFUCKER!
He really flamed him for over a minute and then for some reason decided to end with "There's a new sheriff in town" smh the corniness is inescapable.

LeBron dropped the hammer.  Nothing he said wasn't true about Barkley. I like Barkley, much like Shaq, for the entertainment aspect, not their opinion on the game. He always falls back onto how it use to be, but no one cares Chuck. We just want to hear you butcher names and not know team rosters
Well I guess we know what the sporting world is gonna be talking about for the next week
This some juicy shit. Can't wait for Charles to comment on this. Hope they show it on Thursday.
Barkley hasn't been thrown this much shade since, "Be gone, wannabe. BE GONE"
...what does that even mean?
Bron drops all that fire and then ends with "There's a new sheriff in town" smh
So much fire that it's filled with fallacies?
[quickly googles 'Barkley spits on kid']
Damn I think the kardashians have been around the cavaliers a bit too much now with all this drama
["There's a new sheriff in town"](http://i.imgur.com/jf4BZzY.jpg)
not often i say this but what barkley said wasn't off base like with what he normally says.
My god ESPNs website has really gone downhill.
As much as i like lebron, he brings up his legacy too much. Who cares. Go control what you can and play ball, take care of your family. Hate for him is self brought on, hes been a phenom since he was like 15 but hes gotta understand not to talk about himself.Chuck is for the most part a basketball living legend, and it doesnt matter if he doesnt have a title. Chuck gives respect to everybody who deserved it and has always marveled at Lebron so dont take it personally ya know?
Inb4 LeBron goes to Miami to train with Wade.
Barkley is just doing his job but he's such a bitch.  Dude must be insecure about something because he loves to talk shit about all time great players.  LeBron is still corny but I still love him
Get fucked Chunky Charles
As a Lebron hater, I've never liked him more than after reading this article. Fuck Barkley.
Neither 1 of them is wrong. Barkley is clearly not a great person off the court. Lebron wants to be considered an all time great but he is a punk for jumping ship when things looked rough. Especially leaving Miami for Cleveland. Asking for help while having the highest payroll and he built that team, that's so weak.
Chuck actually said Lebron doesnt want to compete, ludicrous statement, daft.
Lebron got the emotional control of a 11 year old girl, although Chuck certainly dishes it out Bron's digs were out of line.
New sheriff in town
Sometimes Charles just needs to be put it in his place, and LeBron just buried him in the fuckin ground

"I'm tired of biting my tongue," James said. "There's a new sheriff in town."Wtf lol
[Wot in ternation](http://imgur.com/a/xAB7v)
seriously lebron is the lamest 'tough guy' in all of sports.
I actually feel bad for Barkley...man, he's becoming a punching bag. And he didn't even say anything THAT out of line IMO, but LeBron just torched him...  Ever since Shaq joined the show, it's becoming more and more of we laugh at Chuck, not with him : (
Because he's a hypocrite.  I like Chuck, and I enjoy watching him, but there is always going to be a spiteful/hater side to him from never winning a ring.  He's one of the greatest players of all-time, and never got it done.  He spent a lot of time gambling, eating copious amounts of KFC, and mismanaged his career and FA moves until it was too late, he panicked, and joined Houston too late in a desperate attempt to get a chip, and failed.He didn't do everything he could possibly do to win, and deep down he knows it, and that is difficult to live with.  I think he's a good guy and great b-ball player, but that shit will always be with you, and it sometimes comes out in attacking or refusing to recognize other players greatness.His best defense becomes "MJ was the greatest so it wasn't my fault" and recognizing anyone else doesn't benefit his legacy or how he thinks of himself.He lashes out at LeBron because deep down he's mad he didn't do what Bron did, and engineer his own success at the front office level.  It looks bad on the surface (especially with The Decision, one of the dumbest decisions in human history), but the alternative was just staying with the Cavs and their terrible roster/staff and turning into the next Reggie Miller/Chris Webber/Karl Malone.Why would you let your greatness as an NBA player be stifled by a bad front office?  Not everyone gets drafted by the 2000s Spurs or 1990s Bulls.Chuck figured it out too late, and he has never forgiven himself, and spends every day wishing he did what LeBron did while still in his prime.  You can't live every day thinking that, the human psyche won't allow it, it's WAY too unhealthy, so the mind rationalizes and comes to the conclusion LeBron cheated his way to those titles and therefore isn't deserving of a place among the Top 5 greatest players.That's the only way he can wake up in the morning and function.
You hit the nail right on the head with this
Bruh The Decision tv special raised a couple million dollars for charity. It is *not* one of the dumbest decisions in human history. But most of your other points I can agree with.
Seems like Chuck is losing people's respect. Not sure why, maybe it's his lifestyle or how he doesn't ever seem to really pay attention or try or know what is going on.
His constant need to talk about shit he doesn't know anything about aka anything NOT basketball is what irritates me. Really, did we need Charles Barkley's opinion on current events in America? It reminds me of the Ja Rule routine from Chappelle. Shut the fuck up already.
I didn't expect this to be half that savage. Wow, he put it all out on the table didn't he. People complaining LeBron doesn't give good quotes, how is that for you? I like this LeBron.
Damn can't wait for Chuck's response. This league is the best
Everyone in here is acting like LeBron is some roastmaster burn-God for this, but he didn't say *shit* that matters. He answered literally none of the criticism. This is the worst case of ad hominem I've ever seen, but because it's LeBron, everyone is eating it up. Then jumping onto Phil Jackson for literally no reason in the middle? The fuck was that? Sounds to me like Chuck hit a nerve. LeBron went off like this because he was mad, not because he had a point. And all he's done is prove Chuck right.
He showed the world that Chuck owns a little bit of real estate in his head.  I don't think he's the only occupant.
Okay, here is the deal. Charles was 100% correct in his criticism of Lebron. Period. So how does Lebron react? By attacking Charles's character. Notice how he doesn't address a damn thing Chuck said. So yeah, Lebron might be right in addressing Charles's flaws, but guess what, Lebron ain't perfect either. (The Decision anyone? And that's just one example.)So honestly, fuck Lebron here. Just because you got in some honest zingers against the history of a flawed man doesn't deflect what a bitch you've been acting like recently with respect to your words regarding your team. PERIOD.
I still don't agree with all of chucks criticism. It was a bitch move to go public with it, but saying he doesn't want to compete because he thinks they need a backup pg is idiotic.
Chuck's point is that LeBron should be able to win with the roster they currently have and bitching about needing more help to the public is ridiculous. And he's right.
the cavs have an obvious hole at pg thats hurting them a lot and the warriors added kevin durant. if the goal is to win a ring then they should try to fix the obvious problem with the roster. and apparently the team agrees because they are trying out some guys.
Great. Don't bitch to the media about it.
agree with you there
Uh we know all that about Chuck, he doesn't give a fuck. They routinely post his mugshot from his DUI on the show. Not really a roasting, more of a oversensitive whining.
&gt;"Go watch the '93 Finals when John Paxson hit the shot," James said. "Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then."Holy shit, how does LeBron know this off the top of his head?
"rings erneh" is the typical response, but this'll also do.
3\7 legacy? ololo
It's about time someone called Chuck out on his bullshit. He's been sitting on that show talking shit for way too long
tfw charles is the one to trigger lebron this year draymond did it (twice), the celtics collectively did it... except some insane shit soon
Only reason Lebron is getting mad is because he knows what Barkley is saying is true and the truth hurts, regardless of what Barkley did in his time doesn't change the fact that lebron is asking too much from his organisation.
Pretty low to attack someone personally when they were talking about basketball. I hope Lebron has no dirt that he doesn't want to get out.
Somehow I dont think Chuck can win that war of words.
Um, wow.  Kind of an overreaction from LeBron.  Reminds me of a "feud" Kobe had with Chuck years ago.  Except I think Kobe handled it WAY better lmao.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjTm2Dl1bTo
That video just makes me wish Kobe wasnt so baller rich and would sign up for an analyst gig. He made the rest of the crew sound slow and retarded compared to him. Smart guy.
Why are people applauding LBJ for this? He essentially advanced a strawman argument that is irrelevant to Barkley's claims.
Lebron is the biggest crybaby. The flops, the constant attention whoring, the whining about his team not having enough. Dude is a diva on the low.
Damn LeBron goes bang.
At least Charles Barkley has the balls to be himself unlike fake LeBron James.
Boy did Lebron fight back. Which makes sense because Barkley loves to hate the current generation of NBA star's just because their not in his generation. And not just Barkley. Other old players criticize the modern NBA too because of that.Which is really petty.None of the current NBA player's would criticize Lebron's legacy
&gt;None of the current NBA player's would criticize Lebron's legacy#makeOpportunismGreatAgain
Is this Lebron's 4th or 5th kid? Steph, Klay, Dray and Chuck? Who am I missing?
Lue...
He wasn't just the NBA bad boy. Charles was [the baddest man in the world.] (https://youtu.be/nPJ95Tl0A6Q?t=105)
Holy shit I can't wait until Thursday!
inside the nba will see record ratings this week
Honestly Lebron is not losing this one even though he got a bit extra salty but its against Chuck who can be just straight up annoying a lot of times, your move Chuck
Damn I can't wait for Inside The NBA
This is why I stopped watching wrestling because I get all my scripted story lines with the NBA now.
I'm surprised he could say all that without crying or falling down.
Wasn't Lebron the one who was saying he liked playing the bad guy on the Heat a few years ago?
Not sure he threw a man through  plate-glass window on the Heat a few years ago, though
You don't talk trash to Chuck Bron. Just no. Watch out.And LeBron is way off here, attacking personally. He should have kept his rebut within basketball limits. Why didn't he rebut Charles' criticisms? Because he can't. That's just it. He personally attacked Chuck because he cannot defend himself from Chuck's criticisms, because it's all true. He got butthurt and then personally attacked Chuck. Still an immature diva. Nothing has changed.
&gt;And LeBron is way off here, attacking personallyThis got personal when Chuck said LeBron was a whiner who didn't want to compete. LeBron responded to personal attacks with personal attacks.But I don't expect someone with pages worth of post history bashing LeBron to be rational about this, so I can see how you would ignore the fact that Chuck made it personal first.
yo Lebron with the straight fire damnnnnn
Rich Paul stealing Lebron's media interaction scripts from Donald Trump's media team now?
[Been waiting for this drama](http://i.imgur.com/7dPyIyJ.jpg)
Lebron just metaphorically posterized Chuck. I never seen James act like this.
"There's a new sheriff in town."-I think he's referencing Lost.
Can't wait to see what Chuck says in response. We all love Barkley, but is there anyone that talks more trash? Very few athletes have been under the scrutiny LeBron has faced and even fewer have delivered.
The Disney guy is right.
Oh shit.. old man Bron activated. About to see that SSB LeBron fuck up the whole league/
Lebron is so salty cause he knows his team can't beat the warriors. It's sad seeing a player of his ability act like such a bitch.
Did he not beat them on Christmas, did you miss the finals?
Since last year, the warriors added Durant and barring an assist from the commissioner with suspensions, Cleveland is shit out of luck. And then Draymond is gonna troll the shit out of Lebron.
Isn't this about the recent comments that Barkley made towards LeBron? When he said that LeBron was being too whiny and saying we need this player and that player instead of competing with what they got. Something along those lines. I don't agree with Barkley's critiques all the time (especially when he says LeBron would never be top 5) but I completely agree with him there. We've seen this from LeBron constantly where it seems like he is constantly trying to get the front office to make moves and I get it he is not only the best player on the Cavs but the best player in the world. But their salary cap is through the roof and by far the highest in the league. I think this is LeBron probably having a really bad week and voicing those frustrations. But I do agree with Chuck when he says you have to work with what you got.
He said if they want to repeat they need to make a move, and he's right. Saying that it isn't true because they won last year doesn't make sense considering the warriors added kd.
Chucks hot takes are fun, but the longer he sits at that desk, the saltier and saltier he gets about the fact that he never won.
fuck Lebron #ImWithChuck
[How Jordan handled Barkley] (http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1943095-top-10-stories-of-michael-jordan-being-the-greatest-jerk-of-all-time)Scroll down to Number 7.
I love Lebron, But hes kind of a hypocrite for this&gt;All I've done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right wayWhen he has been supporting controversial movements on NBA courts. One's that the NBA didn't want to be represented by and actually banned Lebron and other players from advocating while on NBA courts.
I expect some big stat lines from Lebron in the near future, he better not let me down
While I laughed and smiled at this a lot, as it sets in I just kind of realized how petty this was. Lebron has been a great role model. He is the least scandalous mega star I've ever seen. But god damn is this petty. Lebron made this so personal and straight up called Barkley a broke hater. Oh well. Me likey. Can't wait for Chuck's response.
It's alot easier to say "lol chuck you aint ever one a 'chip"
Barkley just choked on his honey bun and Mountain Dew while reading this.
[Me reading this article](https://youtu.be/beCxSqSXGDY?t=12)
About time. Be genuine for once.
can't wait to hear Barkley's response. hopefully he still has lips after that savage burn.
HOLY FUCK this gave me chills. Come at the King, you best not miss
Trigger fingers turned to Churro Fingers
LeBron saying all facts though...Barkley can't expect to diss LeBron without some backlash
But Barkley said all facts too. But finally someone pushed back against the myth that guys hated each other. Like Magic and Isiah werent kissing each other on the mouth every game in the NBA Finals.
I won't believe this until I see the video. Why no video!?
Lebron has no chill
This is all because Barkley said he shouldn't be publicly pressuring his ownership to spend even more money? Or did chuck say something else?
Talk dirty to me bby
Wow LeBron is pissed off holy shit
Tried finding the interview, here's a [part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLBsYCNHdz8) of it. He seems really bothered.
Just shut up and play
I haven't seen Charles Barkley get owned this hard since he played pickup with those girls in space jam
Was expecting a "that guy on tv" response but Lebron won't be anywhere close to the greatness of Embiid
Lebron does not really stick to the matter at hand here. He is not wrong and Barkley won't deny that. But this has nothing to do with the actual problem Barkley had with Lebron.
Fuckin rekt
http://i.imgur.com/5ngJzwU.gif
I don't think Barkley is gonna feel ashamed and embarrassed to be the NBA "bad boy"
Yikes!
Can we please speak to what a PIECE OF GARBAGE that website is. Not 1, not 2, not 3 .... 7 autoplay videos.
I agree with Charles but LBJ doesn't have enough to repeat unless he goes ape shit like he did in Miami . We never heard Kobe or MJ complain . They just did their thing and WANTED TO WIN WITH WHAT THEY HAD . EVEN WESTBROOK ISN'T COMPLAINING AND LOOK WHO HE HAS . He's competing
Barkley' comeback should be along the lines of: Hey LBJ, I own my shit! I know what I am and I don't pretend to be anything else... unlike you. You're a lying, selfish, thin-skinned flopper who can't (or won't) admit it!
RIP Barkley. LeBron legit has always done the right things in his entire career, which is crazy because he was famous at what, 17 fucking years old? And he hasn't even messed up once
Love the savagery and him speaking out against Chuck who needs to be humbled, but personal attacks were a bit out of pocket. In this case Chuck was strictly talking about basketball. Lebron said nothing that argued the point that Chuck made.
I really want to like Lebron James, but there's something about him that annoys me. I feel like he could be even better than he already is but he just doesn't want to be for some reason.
I can't imagine the amount of shit lebron takes! He is one of the greatest yet everyone is so quick to try and point out his flaws. Yeah, ok he went a bit far attacking Sir Charles but can you blame him? Dude must of been at tipping point for a while now. I know I wouldn't be able to take the kind of pressure he's under! Constantly trying to do the best I could while constantly being scrutinised and belittled by the media, the 'fans', the haters, all while taking some of the heat for my team mates. There are 13 other players on the team, not one of them gets even half the shit he gets. Dude needs a hug man! #GoCeltics
Wtf did Chuck say to him
CRY BABY LEBRONY.. Your Championship Team LOST the Franchise $40 Million.
People wanna act like Charles is right that that Cavs have done enough. Nahhhh, y'all forget the only reason the Cavs won the championship last year is because lebron dropped 2 40 point triple doubles and Kyrie had to go off for 40 in a game too. This team is really as good as LeBron is that night. The superstars he's playing with are Kevin Love who never made the playoffs without lebron and Kyrie who is a great scorer but brings nothing else to the table. Y'all are giving the Cavs front office too much credit for lebron being superhuman.
This reads almost like an Onion article. LeBron is so out of fucks.
Kobe on responding to criticism: "I don't give a [expletive] what you say. If I go out there and miss game winners, and people say, 'Kobe choked,' or 'Kobe is seven-for-whatever in pressure situations.' Well, [expletive] you."Take a page out of Kobe's book, Bron.
Kobe has responded to criticism in so many different ways. Barkley called him selfish in the 2006 Suns series and then Kobe went on the TNT show and then disputed about why he wasn't selfish.
The key difference there is he did it straight to his face
All I'm saying is Kobe has handled criticism in different ways.
Well of course.Kobe is mentally superior to LeBron
So Barkley was running his mouth about basketball and LeBron just retorts with insults? Acting pretty childish, must have struck a nerve like 'posse' did. He didn't even really address the criticism, just talking shit. Barkley may be wrong, but he was still the bigger man here (at least so far, who knows what he'll say now).
nothing Barkley said was wrong.
Yeah, I completely agree with Barkley. Cavs have done everything they could so far and continue to do so. Their cap situation for the future is terrible because of it.
Imo, bit of an overreaction, chuck is somewhat right, he does have alot of peices on his team to be complaining about not having a backup playmaker, lebron didnt need to go after Barkley's career, Charles was never a role model he came into the league saying that and left saying that, i dont know what he was trying to accomplish by saying this, probably just building frustration
14 years of being calm and Charles is the one that causes LeBron to snap. Jesus, Charles. What have you done?
Michael Jordan or any of those old guys would not have given a single fuck about what a TV announcer was saying about him. Lebron didn't even dispute anything Chuck said, he just called Chuck out for other shit he's done
Michael Jordan proved himself on the court, he didn't need to give passive-aggressive interviews
Yeah LeBron really hasn't proven himself yet.
Nothing passive about that response
They're downvoting you here but you're 100% right.
Here we goLebron showing his true self to the public in a way he hasn't in the past Just like his comments after losing to the Mavs, dude is a douche What Barkley said about Lebron was 100% true and you can see it had a HUGE effect on Lebron. He didn't even address Barkley s points, he just attacked his character Edit: also Kenny said the same thing about Lebron &amp; he didn't attack him.
This is always been who Lebron was, this isn't a surprise.
Agreed, not surprised either
I think they were right that going to the media with it was a bad move, but to say he doesn't want to compete and that he has no right to not be satisfied with the roster is stupid.
Damm Lebrons starting to see it all slip away from him and is getting really worried.
This. Which is hysterical cause it's Feb and they are _still_ in first place.
But they aren't even arguing about the same character issues?Barkley is saying James is being lame for publicly calling out for a backup PG to the media. It has nothing to do with James's personal life or off the court antics.Lebron is saying Barkley is a clown and shouldn't be a role model(which Barkley agrees with lol).They're both right. James's comments don't discount Barkley or vis versa.
Barkley has also said that LeBron and other players are too chummy now and it's causing them to lose their competitiveness which LeBron seems to be taking as a shot at his character
Whatever it is, neither discredited the criticisms of the other person. They just insulted each other haha.
I've been complaining about LeBron's whiny attitude lately on Facebook, but damn I'm deleting those posts right now just in case LeBron goes and finds my 8th grade game film just to burn me on TV.  Wow.Please let interview IDGAF LeBron become basketball IDGAF LeBron.  Zero Dark Thirty Bron in February?  CAN'T WAIT.
You whined about someone else whining? Good for you, buddy!
all i see is insecurity from bron here once again ...feels the need to go after someones livelihood based off criticism...plays the money card.... the "hater" card ...i mean apparently everyone has LOVE lebron or hes gonna call you a racist or bring up anything you did wrong in your past.
not a good look for lebron. usually the guy is bulletproof and lets this shit flow right by him. with him responding so defensively it shows a little vulnerability. not the first time the two had a spat, but lebron never gets that personal. interesting to see him sink to that emotional level
Yeah, usually, he let's it bounce off his chest. Particularly, when the person talking isn't on his level. I normally think people should subscribe to the Commandment of "Thou shalt not beef downward" but the last time he let some shit get to him, he created the "3-1 lead" meme. It might not end well for him this time but it will be fun to watch, at least.
kenny said the same shit as Chuck why didn't Lebron go after him too&gt;
Cuz Chucks an easy target
I mean nothing he said in anyway invalidated Chuck's original criticism. This is just a childish deflection because he's angry he got called out. Chuck never said LeBron was a bad guy or represented the NBA poorly. He said that calling out management and saying they need a play maker to the media was inappropriate and whiny, which is valid. Sure LeBron's rant was savage, but it was hardly justified and it doesn't make Chuck wrong, it just makes LeBron kind of an asshole.
What a fucking pussy.  Those were the most innocuous comments about a superstar being a whiny bitch ever made and still complimented him.  The fact they were also true makes it even worse.
Charles Barkley: Lebron James is always asking for help on the basketball court to win championships. He needs to be better to ascend to the top 5 players all time in my list.Lebron James: I have had a perfect career as a role model, unlike you Charles Barkley!
Holy shit he did not hold back
So much drama this season, feel like I am watching a soap opera. Westbrook vs Zaza, KD. LeBron vs Phil Jackson. LeBron vs Chuck. Lillard and D Russ. Matt Barnes vs the coaches. Rondo fights Jimmy and Wade. Many more ahaha
**Holy shit, wtf just happened?** A LeBron tantrum? Thats something rare. I really advise everybody to read this article and not just the comments over here. This is huge (if we are talking about NBA gossip of course), i really thought, this is fake.
Chuck has some dark secret that everybody is being hush-hush about.Bill Simmons said in his book that he buried two stories that would've been very bad for Chuck.
"I know he wanted to retire a long time ago but he can't," James said. "He's stuck up on that stage every week."That shit that makes your soul burn slow
because its so true. lol
only Lebron can criticize the team that he basically built &amp; fans not criticize him
I'm like halfway through the comments on this and nobody has photoshopped a [sheriff hat](http://i.imgur.com/y8zMyWX.png) on Lebron yet...I'll do it if I have to, but I don't have time right now.
LeBron argues the same way my wife does.
everybody had to open their mouth with a mother fucking opinionwell this is how we gonna' do this:fuck Kenny,fuck Charles,fuck TNT as a staff, studio pundit, and as a mother fucking crew.and if you want to be down with TNT,then fuck you too.Phil Jackson, fuck you too.All you mother fuckers, fuck you too.
love this
RIP Chuck
I'm in two minds about this. On one hand, LeBron has every right to go after Barkley since he feels aggrieved probably not just about his recent comments/criticisms about him but for everything Barkley has said over a long period of time. However on the other hand, to go after Barkley in such a nasty, bitter and deeply personal manner is probably not the way he should go about responding back. All it does is continue the 'feud' and unnecessary increases the focus on the Cavs woes and LeBron's 'outbursts'
FUCK YEAH LEBRON
WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE.
LeJohn Cena? Recognize?
Goddamn I didn't know how much I needed something like this till just now. God bless you Bron Bron! Thanks for helping me to forget that our country is a massive dumpster fire for just a moment!
If only Lebron showed this much fight against the Mavericks...
Love this shit
So Charles makes valid point and Lebron attacks his character. As far as their basketball character, I'd rather someone who knows their not a role model than someone who thinks they're the perfect one while whining all the time....
i dont know why this sub gets all excited with Lebron making invalid, out of context attacks on Charles. Lebron is just too sensitive and tried to come out with irrational statements to fire back. smh

I like this LeBron. PR robot LeBron is the lamest fucking player in the NBA
Bron put Charles entire life on blast, got damn
I love cocky Lebron. He's one of the 2 greatest players ever he shouldn't have to take shit from anybody
While I agree with LeBron feeling disrespected, Chuck isn't wrong with the whole whiny comment. What more should LeBron need to compete?
Asking for a backup pg isn't asking for a star. Can people get over that bullshit already? What more did the Warriors need to compete with the Cavs?
Except he asked for another "playmaker". Besides, no one is talking about the Warriors right now. Hell, if you think LeBron is right to ask for another playmaker on a roster like that, what do you say to a team like the Celtics? Last I checked they were only 2.5 games behind the Cavs in the East with only one All-Star. There's really no excuse for the Cavs performance in January with the personnel they have.
Lebron really is great at playing the media. Now no one is talking about the Cav's struggles, they're talking about Lebron owning Barkley. He did this a few months ago when he implied Phil Jackson was a racist after Jackson's posse remarks.
I get that we are happy that LeBron's talking shit now but how did he actually address any of Barkley's criticisms? The Cavs *have* paid everyone that LeBron wanted them to and they are way over the luxury tax. I don't know what else anyone could seriously want out of them.
Can I get audio please
The difference between Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal is that Charles Barkley goes after the likes of Michael Jordan, The Warriors, and LeBron.  Shaquille goes after people like Javale McGee and whoever else he has picked on and ridicules.
I'm so sick of "King James" and his "Legacy".  A legacy is something you talk about when it's been laid down.  He's still playing.
I feel like Bron got all his butthurt about having his hairline colored in with MSPaint many years ago out just now
this is his drake meek mill moment
I don't understand why LeBron gives a shit so much of what Barkley says. Barkley just says shit because it's his job. LeBron made himself look so petty.
LeBron got cliches for days.
Yeah, so cliche bringing up the most precise moments he can about Barkley's career.
Yeah that was a dumb comment lol this is like the one time he wasn't speaking in cliches
"Ugh, so cliche to bring up that time him and MJ were laughing during a free throw, like that's talked about way too much".
Do you seriously think that's what OP was referring to? lmaoPretty sure he meant the whole "new sheriff in town" thing.
That's really not that cliche IMO. And he said he has cliches for days, yet he says apparently one?
he is a corny dude thats for sure. i love it though.
there's a new sheriff in tongue biting his town bruh
This is fake right?!
Fuckin' love it
Whoa
Man... all these 2017 headlines are too crazy and it's been a minute since I've heard anything about Kanye West and stories like this one have me wondering aloud "But what does Kanye think?".
But what does Ja Rule think?
Thursday is gonna be lit
BOOOMMMMMSHAKALAKA!
Are you not entertained, /r/NBA?
I love this LeBron. I don't know where it came from, but holy hell
LeBron to Charles: I have sacrificed everything, what have you given?
Lebron should just shave his head and go full villain mode
It's good that Bron is speaking for himself! As much I enjoy hearing TNT make fun of players, players have every right to fight back and defend themselves. It's a two way street, if you can dish the insults, you can receive the insults. But it was a little too personal, LBJ. All in all, trash talking and drama is good entertainment.
The Kingdom of James has denounced the Despotate of Barkley
I think the Cavs roster is basically an example of the law of diminishing returns.They have 3 max players and two other highly paid players in JR smith and TT. The only reason why they're not the top team right now is that the Warriors signed two GOAT's to very team friendly contracts before they peaked. they would still be good without KD, but really I think they might be unbeatable now that they are clicking... but then again they lost to the Heat the other day
LeBron is getting angry already and it's still January! 40-15-15 averages in the Finals confirmed!
Lebron would probably end the career of anyone who called him out on bad behavior so it doesn't get reported. Plus the NBA doesn't want their main sell to look bad. Just like they did with Jordan which I completely understand. It's a business.
am...am I about to respect Lebron James?
LeBron "The Petty King" James

Lol he salty af
LeBron is going too far with these comments. It's just disrespectful towards Charles Barkley who brought up legit critisism. LeBron is butthurt and cares too much about his legacy.
If anyone thinks Charles feels roasted by this or will backtrack on his comments, you haven't been watching TNT for the last decade. Charles doesn't make statements for ratings. Everything is presented as his opinion, not as fact, unlike  other clickbait shows. He's not afraid to be a hypocrite. And he's heard all the criticism of himself. So if you think Lebron owned him by bringing up his past, I guarantee you Charles doesn't think so. How many times has he called James the best player in the NBA? This style of arguing from James is really annoying and grade school. If you criticize James for being too friendly with other players, how is your counter-argument "Look at the 1993 Finals, you did it too!" Thats like when kids hit each other and say the other person started it. He should just say "Yeah. So what. We're friends off the court but I compete harder than anyone on the court" which is true. But thats the way we argue nowadays I guess. Trying to own someone by making them look like a hypocrite is more acceptable than just correcting them.
&gt;"I'm tired of biting my tongue," James said. "There's a new sheriff in town."cheesy
This is equivalent to "you're not a good GM because x,y,z" and Lebron coming back with "Yeah, well your wife doesn't love you." Whether someone has gotten in trouble with the law or not, you're making an argument personal for no reason whatsoever.  Let's call it like it is, Lebron is Kim Kardashian. Stir the pot, and HEAVEN FORBID the cameras leave him for 2 seconds out of the day.
He questioned Lebrons desire to compete, Chuck got what he deserves. He sits up there constantly bashing players and the league as a whole.
That's his job.
It's his job to talk shit? I get its his job to talk about the NBA. Questioning a player with 3 rings, 3 FMVP, 4 MVP desire? Get out of here with that bullshit. That's why Lebron said "I'm not gonna let him talk about my legacy" Charles has no right to question his desire. The 73 win warriors added KD, a top 3 player in the world, meanwhile Cavs added basically nothing. Cavs barely won last year as it is, of course he wants a little more help.. Did you see what he had to do just to barely win last? Why is Lebron the only one expected to do shit like that.
He (Barkley) is there for entertainment.  So yes, he is paid to be openly critical about matters concerning the NBA.  You won't find anyone else with the right match of personality, attitude, and resume to do that job.Regarding your complaint about players seeking opportunity... Lebron James made it acceptable in today's NBA.  He will go down in his career as a player that needed to be coddled in order to win.  And he knows this, which is why he got personal.
People criticizing LeBron for this, dude he has been nonstop criticized since he has been in the league and has done nothing but just take it. He can defend himself once. So what he finally snapped back. Especially when you catch him after a loss in the middle of his team slumping, you don't think this was bound to eventually happen? Chuck wanted the ratings and LeBron gave it to him.
Oh come on. Chuck had valid points and lebron brings up him spiting on a kid? Lebron is just crying more and proving Chuck right
[deleted]
20+ mil / year doesn't buy thick skin
I always appreciated barkleys not a role model comments. At least he was honest and the obsession we have with famous people being "role models" was always weird to me
Yeah, Barkley is honest that he's not a role model while LeBron pulls that "family man" act. Now that he's losing, he's starting to throw punches and be a bitch.
what a fucking crybaby lmao. he didn't have to do my mans chuck like this. All Chuck said was LeBron should stop trying to play GM and just go win. LeBron came for his whole life lmaoooo wtf. Bron really can't handle any criticism at all
Goddamn basketball is the best game
Poor LeBron. Can't handle not being liked. Guess what bud, you don't deserve everyone's adulation.
Please tell me this is real
This is real. Fucking crazy
It's about time. It's about fucking time he's been getting at him for years.
Chuck is spot on with his criticisms.  LBJ left Cleveland after losing in the NBA finals to pair with two other all-NBA talents, winning two rings while Cleveland accumulated draft picks.  Then when it becomes a bit more of a challenge, what does he do?Returns to a team that's absolutely loaded with young talent (Kyrie, Thompson, Wiggins), and basically forces a trade with two of their three no.1 overall picks for the best player available (Kevin Love).  Is he the best player in the game?  Absolutely.  Will his legacy absolutely wreak of opportunism?  I don't see it any other way.  The worst part of all of this is that ring-seeking is becoming a thing.
If you think ring seeking wasn't a thing before you haven't been watching for very long
Just my opinion but sounds like Lebron is deflecting. I think people forget how much dumb shit Lebron said early in his career.
LeComback
Holy shit batman
Where's that dude that said LeBron isn't quotable?Look at what you've done
[I just wanna say one thing Erneh](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/atQF-YFtqm8XfUyH8vaXRvqziN6A8DDfVHSnHDh4HYySWm04hlAjwuxK6-vaflbWCLQJV0IcTHotkbrT1qUtXXhntCuVm3HVij81rsxNAaswhKCc0AF6D0ui_a60paK3T6PAKmZu-qWRioZuXFbufYhWoslgwCoF=w447-h329-nc)
I don't get it. I, and every generation before me grew up taught that you shouldn't care what people say about you and think about you. I don't understand at all why the current generation is obsessed with this. Even the athlete role models are worried about people and the media, and what they say and write. The stars of the past (publicly) lived by the credo that they didn't worry about, or think about, what people said and wrote about them. They just "played the game and let their game speak for itself." I guess I have finally become old. "Get out of my yard!"Edit: spelling
Social media came into play, and people often take it way too seriously.
Lmao he let Barkley get to his head.
The true LeBron is showing now that he's been losing. He's a dick, deserves all the criticism and losses that he gets.
Still a losing team in Jan, still whined about adding talent. CB has a point, shouldnt have made it personal, but James is and always has been a whiner..
I'm surprised people are so supportive of Lebron on this. His criticisms are funny and all and definitely cut pretty deep on Chuck but they're also textbook ad hominem. Chuck wasn't ever calling Lebron a bad person. All of Lebrons comments are so off base. I can understand him being fed up but this response has nothing to do with the original point.
Exacrtly! He never called james a bad person. He criticized him as a basketball player. He never once said james was a bad role model. It is so off from what charles was talking about. I think hes just deflecting his issue of wanting a point guard playmaker.
When I saw the headline, I figured it'd be another typical case of the media blowing one sentence out of proportion, but holy shit LeBron SHREDDED him.
This is really just about Chuck making fun of Brons balding.
I like this LeBron.
hooolyyyy shit SCORCHING
King takes knight.
Mad Lebron is best Lebron
LeRoaster said Barkley can meet him on the court lmao
I'm so fucking excited for Inside the NBA now lol
Damn, first Shaq, now LeBron...Sir Chaz devoid of love...
He don't know bout back to back. He do. Kenny do. Bron do.
This is more juicy than any WWE storyline right now!
It's about time.For far too long, the fact Charles Barkley isn't a generic robot or isn't an ex-football player with CTE has given him the pass to make asinine comment after asinine comment that is backed up by nothing but his incredibly shortsighted and bad opinions.
Personally, I think the NBA media needs someone like Barkley to shake things up and make it interesting. I don't think he does any of it to offend anyone but rather he is playing devils advocate
Charles (maybe all of us) have a habit of being a hypocrite.  My favorite is when Charles was on The Herd and said no, college students should not get paid. Their education is their pymt.He was the one who took money from his future agent while in college and left a year early to cash in and never graduated.
When I read LeBron's comments, all I could think about was him complaining to referees after every whistle and flopping all the time in every game that I watch him in, but there's no question he plays hard, dominates &amp; wants to win. When I think back to watching Charles play, I remember him doing a lot of dumb things (which usually led to technical fouls) but there was no question he played hard, dominated &amp; wanted to win. It's two different generations of basketball &amp; two different styles. The league was a lot different when Charles Barkley played. Big men mattered more than they do now. Fouls were called different. Hell, rules were different.Barkley and the Suns ran into Jordan and the Bulls. James and the Cavs are going to run into the Golden State Warriors.The things LeBron said about Charles weren't even false, they were just irrelevant. What does Charles' gambling debts have to do with LeBron trying to play G.M.? Charles Barkley was talking about basketball, LeBron's game, the Cavs' issues &amp; LeBron was talking about Barkley as a person outside of the game of basketball. That's deflecting.LeBron James is the greatest basketball player in the world. He's a Hall of Fame player. He's a physical freak of nature. I feel like he is lashing out because he's frustrated. There's a bigger picture here. LeBron is also getting older, he's played A LOT of basketball in his years in the league &amp; the number of minutes he's playing this year is insane. He can't do that forever.Shaquille O'Neal was alright right when he told Charles Barkley on Inside the NBA that he didn't know what it was like to have to try to go back-to-back to win NBA Championships.Charles Barkley was right. It's hard to keep asking for more when you've already been given everything you've ask for. When their payroll is that high, how much more are you wanting them to spend? Barkley didn't even bring up the Tristan Thompson situation when LeBron got him paid too.
I like it..  Chuck needs to stop hating.
Man first KG and now LeBron. Charles has a family guys.
LeBron came with heat
Can someone tell me what the story with the window is? Who did he throw through a window?
Oh shit LeBron ain't playing no more
father of 3 still so sensitive?
Man we need that guy itsreal85 from YouTube to make a video of Lebron talking straight petty shit like that one he did of Jordan. This shit is too good for just memes
Young Lebron: Hate 'emOld Man Lebron: This guy is great in every way!
GODDAM James heel flip
This is what happens when you turn basketball game broadcast into a men's version of The View. You put these talking heads on Tv long enough you start to stir up drama. I for one am SO sick of turning on TV just to see everyone's fucking personal opinion on some bullshit topic that they feel is so fucking important. TELL. ME. LESS.
TURN. IT. OFF.
It's just whatever, man. The longer I keep my head in the sand and try to not read today's news, or watch today's tv the better off I am. You all can have it.
[When lebron goes hard] (https://imgur.com/fvU9wJg)
Just shows LeBron is a cry baby and cares what others think instead of proving them wrong and being the bigger man to turn his cheek.
Love this, villain lebron is best lebron.
Fuck man, did this really need to happen right before we play the Cavs?They already lost to Dallas, Sacramento, and the Pels, can't Bron give us this one to make it fair?
If you haven't been paying attention - we've been playing like ass this month, particularly against sub-.500 teams. We won't have Love tomorrow and I daresay anyone who think the Cavs are winning tomorrow with ease is being foolish.
**WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE**
&gt;I never said, 'I'm not a role model.'Welp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DccOb5sgBG0
I thought that maybe LeBron had crossed a line with going at Barkley's neck...then I saw Stephen A. say that LeBron crossed a line, and I immediately thought LeBron didn't go far enough.
obligatory LeBron James with no regard for human life
Does it occur to anybody that the Cavs don't win because they don't need to win? They have lost so many games and they are still 2.5 games ahead of the second team in their conference. They get to rest throughout the regular season and the first month of the playoffs. Such is the state of the Eastern Conf.EDIT: forgot one more point: It has been LeBron's strategy for the past couple seasons to use this part of season when they start losing games to go to the Media and Pressure the Cav's F.O. to pay extra for acquiring new and expensive talent. This is kind of a pattern now.
I can't wait to hear what else Lebron will have to say if this means he is done biting his toung on other stuff too.. 😬 His ball fact game is strong.
i really dislike LBJ.
So.... does this new sheriff in town have some sort of posse with him?Definition of Posse = a body of men summoned by a sheriff to enforce the law.
God damn son! Okay Lebron, you finally have my attention!
To quote the immortal TO, better get your popcorn ready!
LeBron is the jose mourinho of the nba. Team playing shit? Cook up some spicy beef to put all the heat back on yourself and leave the team to get it's shit together.
I've never really liked James, but this article makes me like him a little more. I hate when the guys don't speak their mind. Let it fly!
FUCK Charles Barkley.. the league is fucked.. LeBron is fucking enragedYOU DONT POKE THE FUCKING SLEEPING BEAR YOU MOTHERFUCK

LeBron been practising that roast in the shower for years. Been building it up, adding to it over time.
Brt
LeBron switchin back to heel?
Don't like Lebron but this interview was amazing.
Spicy
Finally Lebron speaks up about Chuck. Now only if he starts doing it to the other players like Draymond who always get under his skin
ERNEHH!!!!
Lebron nodded
I can't wait for All Star Weekend, Can I get Smack/URL to host Bron vs. Barkley....I mean we can probably fly in Organic and Bishop Brigante if Smack isn't available
live at Wrestlemania this year: LEBRON AND SHAQ tag team match vs DRAYMOND AND BARKLEY!!
Who said Lebron wasn't quotable!?!
GO LEBRON, GO!!!!!!
He didn't just shit on Barkley. He shit on the entire TNT family. Wow.
this is why lebron is the chosen one.hail to the king
Honestly, this is pretty poor from Lebron. I love the guy, but this is not how you respond to criticism. Whether Charles' comments were fair or not is another issue. But having an outrageous opinion doesn't mean it's ok to have personal attacks shot at you. Lebron should've responded with criticisms of Barkley's comments and his role as an analyst. Responding by taking shots at Barkley's past is just childish, frankly. He also kind of defeated his own point by citing Barkley's "I am not a role model" ad. The whole point is that Barkley never pretends to be one. Lebron, though, does have a persona as a good role model ( and is one)Not surprised most of the sub is celebrating him as a "savage". Imo, Lebron was out of line.
While I agree with a lot of LeBron's criticisms, they have nothing really to do with Barkley's recent criticisms of him.  Lol, he's just roasting him because he's pissed
This is funny. Why does Lebron care about what Chuck says anyway? Anything Chuck says about James isn't going to affect his legacy. The only legitimate reason I can think of that James would feel the need to respond is a feeling of frustration and he's defensive because he might believe there might be some truth to what Chuck says. Other than that, there really isn't a soul alive that Lebron should care about talking shit about him.
Someone further up said that it could be to get all the media attention on him to detract from the fact that his team have been playing like dirt this month. I think he's probably just frustrated and Chuck's an easy target, no one really knows but James
If it is a distraction, it isn't working. His team playing like shit this month is attached to everything he says. But he is definitely frustrated.
Man, one bad month and LeBron loses his mind?! Is Simmons next? Simmons said on his latest pod that "LeBron should stop being such a baby". Here's a tip for LeBron: if you complain about talent while being on: 1. The defending champs 2. The most expensive team in the league 3. Currently 1st place in your conference people are gonna say stuff (rightly so in my opinion). Chuck didn't deserve this beat down.
Damn LeBron with the bottom dialogue option on mycareer
He made it personal. Chuck hurt his feelings.
man this is great..lebron better be ready though.he basically opened himself up for everyone wanting to throw shade at him for the longest time but cant because he's the poster boy of the nba. he's been a role model,yes. but he's widely known as a diva too.so imagine the stories from anonymous sources that would come up..
Charles is going to go fuck LeBron's mom.
I dont think he'd have the energy.
&gt;"I went to see Melo at the Garden two years ago when we were in New York," James said. "They played Portland. I went up to a suite at halftime and Phil Jackson didn't say one word to me."This seriously surprises me. Does PJ not like LeBron?
I think he's mad Lebron has always referred to Pop as the greatest coach ever and not him.
Doubt a man with 11 rings and who coached the GOAT and the Black Mamba (and Shaq) is petty enough to care that much about who LeBron thinks is the best coach
But that's the thing. Phil IS petty. You think all the drama between him and Melo came from nowhere?
Call me crazy but I think it came from Melo.
He's done that before this season?
Yup
LeBron is acting really sensitive lol
He is right though. Highest payroll in NBA history, they had -$40 million in earnings before interest and tax, last year, and Lebaby is whining about them not spending enough money.
Lebron is right too though. He said they need to make a move to compete, is that wrong? The warriors added kd and the cavs got worse.
The Cavs definitely spent a lot (im actually on their side) but do not believe their Hollywood accounting for a minute. They didnt lose money. Sports franchises lie all the time about their true revenue
&gt;Sports franchises lie all the time about their true revenue Ownership might have additional revenue streams that are not tied to the team, but it is illegal for them to lie about their finances... for many reasons.
They absolutely lost $40 million in EBIT. Not only did they pay $53 million in luxury tax, but they also had to pay player salaries to the tune of $130 million, that created that luxury tax. It's not hard to see when they are spending about $100 million more than an average NBA team, that they are losing $40 million.
Lebron isn't doing a very good job of convincing everyone he's not a bitch
i love all the beef this season
Does anyone have a link to him saying this? I couldn't find one. I just thought it would be funnier to listen to it not doubting he actually said it.
Lol, get him Chuck.
LeBron salty af googling all of chuck's incidents.
What i don't get is why lebron had to go there? - it just seems so out of context to attack barkley personally - why?. I get that he got offended or some bullshit - but does he not get is barkleys job to give his honest opinion? - does he want people to sugar coat their opinions for the sake of his feelings?. I just don't see why he &gt;needs&lt; to do that. It almost seems like he wants to get something out of it. But what? - to be seen as a badass for taking shots? (in a conversation that had no need for such) - does he want to inspire his teammates or some shiet? - is he just pissed off about everything and is lashing out?. I mean i believe he cursed for the first time not long ago or some shit.I personally - am with barkley on this - both in argument - and in this whole debate thing. Because i just don't see why lebron had to go there. And how it's relevant to barkley giving his opinion - what does barkleys career have to do with his opinion honestly?. Does this mean - that if michael jordan agreed with chuck - he would lash out at MJ too?. He basically is saying "only someone above me can criticize my legacy" - which is quite egotistical - especially when multiple people agree it's justifiable. I disagree that you need to be an MJ/Bird/Magic etc to give your honest educated opinion on a topic like basketball. And be right. I think how lebron reacted is quite egotistical. Especially because Barkley too me was a great player. And he is respected - hence why he has a job in such a field - for his opinion.Barkley used the word "whiny" to describe lebrons requests for more help as the best player in the world - specifically how he did it - which was through public media. And guess what - to me - in this situation - whiny seems appropriate too. Ok Lebron, we get it - you're above everybody - no one should criticize you. That's how it unfortunately seems to me.
Holy fuck, this is the LeBron that I never knew I wanted to see. If his demeanor was always like this, he would easily be my favorite player.
Was feeling underrated in the quote game and decided to light it up. Loving this!!
LeBron unhinged
What is happening in the NBA this past week or so? Good lord.
Barkley only tells the truth, to millennials the truth means you're attacking them or bullying them.  All the past GOATS never openly complained about needing more superstar players on the same team, we only recently found out that Kobe demanded a trade in 07.  Jame didn't get ring until he combined with other superstar and still got exposed by teams built from the ground up (Spurs, Mavs, Golden State). So he wants to be *one of* the greats ever but he don't act like one.
He didn't asked for another superstar...He asked for a bench player.
Everyone knows he wouldn't have went back to Cleveland if they didn't have 2 or more superstars....
You said he openly complained about not having a superstar, he didnt.
[Play-maker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2017/01/24/frustrated-lebron-james-desperately-wants-the-cavs-to-get-a-playmaker/?utm_term=.138e1aa57375) / superstar, call it what you want....
i dont think you understand the situation. the spot they are looking to fill is backup point guard. when he says playmaker he just means someone capable of handling the ball and to give a little bit off the bench. its impossible for them to sign anything close to a superstar with the cap restrictions they are under. they are looking at mario chalmers and kirk hinrich lol
I get it, but it's like the Warrior's signing Durant, losing games, and then Durant blaming their losses on a back up point guard! You're gonna get criticized, I mean Love and Kyrie were 20+ ppg stars of their teams and he is the best player in the league so there should be no excuses
all i said was that you incorrectly claimed that he said he needed another superstar. i wasnt justifying his statements.
Yeah those two terms don't mean the same thing. The man's trying to deal with GSW who picked up Durant. Give him a break.
He asked for another bench player.  He told them to pay TT, he told them to get JR, he wanted Dunleavy, he wanted Korver, he wanted a new coach.  Cleveland has jumped whenever LeGM has called his shot, and it hasn't worked.Really what Charles has said is LeBron just needs to focus on playing, and cut out the coaching and personnel decisions.  But you know, that's why he left Miami, right?  Riley wasn't going to bow down to someone with such an "incredible basketball mind."
Whoa whoa I call bullshit on all of that, can you prove any of it?  The TT thing was between Rich Paul and the Cavs. Lebron even signed while that was going on so people couldn't say he was leveraging. He told them to get JR? Lol the Knicks famously "threw in" Jr as a freebie. You obviously don't know what you're talking about.
Get it done!!!! Straight up. #MissMyBrother @realtristan13This was LeBron's tweet on the subject when the sides were apart on a deal.I hate coming into another season — two years in a row — with one of my big guns not here. So, for a leader of a team and for me personally, I just hate to deal with this bleep again. It’s just too big of a piece to our team to have to deal with in another training camp.” James was referring to power forward Tristan Thompson’s holdout last training camp.That's a quote from him when JR wanted more than Cleveland wanted to pay him.Free agent I'm hearing that LeBron James would love the Cavs to sign: Chicago's Mike DunleavyThere's news from Marc Stein, on LeBron wanting Dunleavy.And do I really need to dig up any of the controversy of him picking a new coach?
&gt; we only recently found out that Kobe demanded a trade in 07.If you were alive to witness it yourself, you would know that it was widely known at the time that Kobe was demanding a trade.
I stand corrected, he did say in 07 on ESPN radio that he would like to be traded
I think lebron had to do some research before lashing out at chuck. hahaha. I find it hilarious. He waited this long to say something about chuck.
Where were you when Charles Barkley died?
take the sand out of your vagina, LBJ
still whiny
LeBron James the least quotable star? Make thatold. My man mad now.
Barkley is a hater against the warriors and LeBron? It must be fun being said ports pundit like him.
This is the LBJ I want

Fuck with your soul like Ether.
That's not a very safety pin like thing to say Lebron.
.. I like this.a lot.I can't wait for Thursday.
I've been a fan of LeBron James since he was on the Lightning Lemony Bubblicious bubble game wrapper and I've never heard him talk like this.
Bron has been raked in the media before...makes me wonder what caused him to fire back this time.Not saying it wasn't warranted, mind yo...I actually thought what he said was pure fucking gospel...but I've heard a lot worse before (even recently about the same subject). Why call out Barkley specifically?
This is the best NBA season ever
Lmao omg I have hated Lebron for years and still will but god damn that guy is taking shots, head shots only, no one is safe, new sheriff in town don't give a fuck.
Oh my god! I love the NBA these past few weeks. From the Bulls' implosion, constant Melo rumors and now Lebron becoming the "new sheriff" and going off. People who only watch the playoffs are missing out.
Tell that no-ring-having, combative shithead LeBron! I love it.
To anyone who's read the Iliad LeBron is like a real life Achilles.
Today I am on Team LeBron.
"Everybody in the Ghetto know what ya doing/ One white boy and two fucking champions"
I'm with Chuck on this. Lebron should have spoken to Griffin privately.
Instead of coming bak with why chuck was wrong, u spit out insult after insult. What are you, five years old? Plus Chuck was definitely right. When the fuck is it enough. The Cavs are spending the most in the league and that still aint enough for you.
chuck's job is the best job in sports
Why did he have to go and get LeBron all fired up before playing my Timberwolves? Oh well, wasn't expecting to win anyway..
He plays like in cursive
LeBron talking about his own legacy.**KEK**
LeBron doesn't owe Barkley shit. LeBron is a 3x champion, the best player in the world, smarter than half of the currently employed coaches, and a tremendous leader.The only thing Barkley has done that LeBron hasn't is bitch for a trade. Chuck has his right to criticize, but he's wrong and should shut the fuck up. RIP Cavs skid.
How is he wrong?
I like LeSavage more than LeNice.
Long live the king. I bet TNT is lovin this
There is a good deal of entertainment in there but I think this paragraph is interesting and has some validity."James also spoke up about the perception he and his inner circle face as young, successful black businessmen, believing that identity being so rare in the power structure of professional sports makes him and his partners targets."
Holy shit.  Can we have the police do a wellness check at the Barkley residence?
its wwe all over again.wrestlemania.Charles vs Lebronwhy are people down voting? you dont wanna see stuff like shaq vs big show or trump vs mcmahon? T.T
