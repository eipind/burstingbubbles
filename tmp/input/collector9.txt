Hey he hit the net not officially an airball
Nothing but net
Lebron isn't even top 10 anymore. Should trade him for Swaggy P and get some leadership on the Cavs. /s
thanks for putting the /s I thought you were being serious
Are you being sarcastic?
Yes /s
/serious
I don't know what to believe anymore
Start with yourself!
Does anyone ever read these blatant sarcasm posts that still have a sarcasm tag as if they were being sarcastic about being sarcastic? Like I read that as "Lebron is obviously still an amazing player despite this miss." Then the /s tag comes along and adds "Yeah right..." Imo the /s tag should never be used for any reason. If your sarcasm isn't obvious, then you suck at sarcasm or maybe your reader is retarded, but we don't need to pander to people with bad reading comprehension.
I've never liked it, it ruins the comment, its just that people put it there to force a joke and not get downvoted
When you explain a joke after telling it, the joke becomes unfunny. That's probably like the first or second rule of comedy.
The point is that it's hard to display sarcasm over the internet, because you can't display a tone of voice through text.

"Everybody get up, it's time to airball."
You just don't understand. LeBron missing that free throw was a next level tactical play to psychologically dismantle the rockets. By missing his free throw, the Rockets learned that LeBron doesn't even NEED easy points. LeBron wanted to mentally intimidate James Harden, and he did so by demonstrating that he didn't even NEED to make the shot to hit nothing but net.
I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often honestly. Players get tired.. shoot it short.
It's a well known fact that DeAndre Jordan always plays so hard that he's usually exhausted by the time he has to shoot his FTs. Right guys?... Guys?...

Lol at the Cleveland commentators making no mention of it. "He's got another one coming", moving it right along, I see you.
Probably my least favorite announcers in the league. So biased.
they're home announcers, nothing wrong with them rooting for their own team
To not even acknowledge the airball is some North Korea bullshit though.
LITERALLY HITLER/KIM JONG UN
BIASED MEDIA CENSORS LEBRON JAMES FREE THROW! BASED ASSANGE REVEALS TRUTH IN LATEST BATCH OF WIKI LEAKS!!!!!

#DRAINTHEFREETHROWS
They showed a replay of it right after and they both talked about it then
Good thing they did then. How does a comment that has no basis in reality get that many upvotes?
It's called reddit, not thoughtaboutit
Maybe I am spoiled but I grew up with announcers that weren't really biased towards the team. Its honestly annoying listening to most home announcers for that reason. A little is ok but I can't stomach Celtic/Portland/Cleveland home announcers.
I love my Raptors announcers. They're definitely homers but they can appreciate when another team is playing well
That's what all of them are like.  People just like to piss and moan.
fuckin love the lakers announcers. great duo
Yeah stray up, stu lantz would have been like "did he just airball, no no no, I must be seeing things"
Thats because Lakers announcers were basically national TV announcers for many years.
Not even a Lakers fan, but after watching my first few games that had Chick Hearn commentating, the bar was set really high for me too. The guy just loved good basketball no matter who or where it was coming from and was more like an "NBA commentator" than just a "Lakers commentator" for me. He was also really progressive; despite being old school, you'd never guess he'd appreciate the likes of a rookie Iverson.From then on, without even listening to Lakers commentating for most of the games I watched, I ended up wanting that kind of unbias from every commentator.
The commentators for the Kings are pretty great. They root for their home team yet still manage to stay unbiased and will point out things like good defense from the opposing team.
You've clearly never watched a Celtics broadcast
Im pretty sure Scal would start making fun of whoever airballed the shot if it was a celtics broadcast.
He ain't talkin bout Scal
Celtics announcers are greathttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8KKrtceth8
I'M THE KING, YER MAKIN A JESTER OUTTA ME!
Minus 1 Tommy point for you.
In fairness, this is by design.  Red Auerbach used to always want the celtic announcers to be biased.  He wanted the games called like a random fan would call them.  My hunch is that the continued homerism for Celtics broadcasts is from that same intentional place
They're bias but they're so entertaining to listen to imo. They say some hype shit when a Cavs player makes a sick play. I'd take hype homers over boring unbiased commentators any day.
celtics tho
They are fun when the Cavs are winning because of how high energy they are and fun they can be but they are the biggest and most annoying homers announcers. I still think the rockets/pacers have the worst commentators because of how boring their crews are.
Uh, Quinn Buckner is the shit. Dude will make you understand whats going on even if youve never watched basketball a day in your life. Quinn Buckner is many things, boring he is not. Chris Denari and our sideline reporter now, i totally agree with you.
Obviously, I'm biased but all home announcers skew the broadcast. Austin Carr just has fun with it and takes it to the extreme.
The one guy's voice is so soothing though
MJ never airballed a freethrow
Thats a lie and I will not allow it to stand.https://youtu.be/5elBYYSFy00?t=20s
That was terrible and you know Jordan is probably still fuming about it to this day.
Things MJ probably still think about today:- This throw- Shaq dream shaking him to hell and back- Why he released any Jordan shoe past 14s
16 were good, and the 2011 were pretty awesome too. xx8 was a great basketball shoe but other than that, these $200 retros are bullshit... as I put my banned 1's away lol
I wouldn't be caught dead in 16s
The newer releases like xx8 and xxx are good ass basketball shoes but I wouldn't rock them outside the court lol. 90s shoes are the most fresh and the recent ones are the best bball shoes. 03-07ish is just a bunch of lord knows what
Shaq did what? I'm just getting into basketball so be gentle
https://youtu.be/1NwgNLW9ASQ
The nostalgia is palpable. Those warmup suits are slick.
I wish uncut video like this was more common. And sound that picks up player talk in games. Although it would all end up getting censored..
[We could all use some more of this in our lives.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7AAD5Sx2jw)
The video got linked but I think the terminology is what you were asking about haha. "Dream Shake" is a post move that was Hakeem Olajuwon's signature move. Shaq does it in that video, and MJ entirely falls for it
I like the xxx honestly
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Nah, he just got great odds on the "ball" first pitch prop bet.
That really surprises me. Someone with nerves of steel like MJ who is also a pretty decent baseball player (yea I know his minor league stint was more about publicity, but he still played baseball at probably a higher level than the average bear) should be able to get it kinda close.
MJ was a not completely awful AA player after not playing baseball at any level for 15 years. Plenty of legit MLB prospects flame out well before even making AA. That MJ even hit .200 all else considered is honestly pretty impressive IMO
In an absolute sense he was a terrible AA player. Given the circumstances he did respectably, but relative to other AA players he was garbage.
Yea, I'm pretty sure your average casual player would get smoked by pitchers all the way down in single A.
*Cough*Tim Tebow*Cough*
Read somewhere that he was pulling a prank on the catcher.
did mj write it?
Genuinely wondering if this is true, in games atleast
I mean he made one with his eyes closed
More than one.

You spend years taking shots from the exact same spot into the exact same area with the exact same dimensions. At some point I'd figure for a veteran player eyes are 0% of the equation in whether you make or miss the shot.
I know he missed a dunk at least.
That was Wizards Jordan, it doesn't count.
Well, if it happened on the Wizards, then it happened more than once. It happened on the Bulls as well.
Shhhh we don't talk about that
What about when Iverson crossed him, do we talk about that?
http://i.imgur.com/lp2i9j4.gifv
Oh yes we can talk about that.
Seems unlikely, just based on the hundreds of attempts. MJ'd be the guy to never airball it though
Something tells me Michael Jordan has more than "hundreds" of attempted free throws
Technically hundreds describes thousands. It's just more hundreds.
Jordan has shot dozens of free throw.
Michael Jordan has shot at least one free throw.
This wasn't even the first time Lebron airballed a freethrow...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vkq9BcZQqY&amp;feature=youtu.be
Wtf, announcers don't mention the air ball either time. This is straight censorship.
Nothin but net
Technically correct. The best kind of correct.
Software update incoming
That makes today a memorable day for me. Just this afternoon I air-balled a free throw. I share a basketball thing with the king on this day.
Also the Indians are in the process of blowing a 3-1 lead.
Only Cleveland sports could have the incredible fortune of a team coming back from a 1-3 deficit to force a game 7 (and win the championship) in the same year a team has the misfortune of blowing a 3-1 lead to allow a game 7 (results: in progress).Results are in: Cubs 4-3 over Indians.
They better not fucking blow it. If Kluber pitches, they should be alright... I hope
King needs to be recalibrated
Looks like he forgot to flip the switch for his legs back on
He's gonna have to take his annual 2-week vacation to Miami a little earlier this year.
As long as he doesn't stay for 4 years again...
If Steph Curry did this the reaction would be crazy compared to how it is atm with Lebron
Yep would be at 3000 right about now. If KD did it it would be at 5000 with 8K+ comments calling him a bitch.
Hurr durr Durant signs with the rims LOL what a ringchaser.
Lmao that's actually pretty funny though
&gt; 2766 pointsY'all need to be a little more patient before preemptively bitching about stuff like this
[it might even be the top post!](http://i.imgur.com/fHXg2fn.png)
I mean, Curry is the best free-throw shooter in the league, so it'd be a much bigger deal.
One free throw in the middle of a regular season game will never be *that* big a deal.
Makes sense Steph is supposed to be a shooting god.
If Drummond did it we'd be telling him to shoot it underhand, if Javale did it this video would be a meme.
Curry also shoots a bit better
slapping hands with someone who just airballed seems like bad luck
It's the opposite-- not slapping hands is bad luck. More likely to get tilted if people just ignore you  every time you miss lol
Fitting for his aloof demeanor this game.
Lebron goes 80% during the regular season so that means he makes it 80% of the way to the rim when he shoots
Where were you when this happened!
On Reddit
why are people downvoting this thread lol
Because Lebron fans dont want anyone to see it
I think it's hilarious lol

Weird he didn't even acknowledge it. Most stars would probably laugh about it and get ribbed by their teammates especially early in the year in a meaningless game.
You don't laugh at the gm.
Did he make the second one?
yes
Skip Bayless is gonna have a field day with this one...
nah he's busy arguing starting a rookie over romo right now
Why is LeBron playing like a potato?
Reg season Lebron
Took a page out of the Spurs' playbook a few years back. During the regular season he cruises; does just enough to get the 1 seed in the east, then playoffs come around and he reminds everyone why he's one of the goats
It's really the only smart way to play as you get older.
https://youtu.be/0Vkq9BcZQqY
What the hell is it with Bron's free throws when playing the Rockets!?
His throwing motion gets tired watching Harden take so many.
How long until this video disappears?
What video?
he also jinxed then indians earlier today with those 3-1 cookies LOL
This looks like nothing but net to me.
Are they just going to pretend that didn't happen?
What didn't happen?
Still pretty ridiculous for the talking heads to be using this as a case to him not being top 5 all time... God I hate Skip Bayless

Lol it's like when that pain in the ass boss fucks up in front of the whole staff. Everyone notices but everyone pretends like jack shit happened.
Didn't say a word about the 1 &amp; 1/2 guys that high five him afterward either
By contrast, I actually really like the new Rocket's announcer. He calls it like he sees it, and isn't afraid to give our team some shit. And he's pretty damn funny.
"I know I airballed it but you don't talk about it, I'm a husband and a father. "
Flair up bitch
He is probably getting fired if he stressed the airball out...
They did talk about the airball though, what game were you watching?
Lebron is just ridiculous. Just keeps getting better with age!
Everyone does it every once in awhile. But when I do it, it's the third time in a row, and then I look around to see if anyone is looking at me.
*Proceeds to wipe hands on shorts, blow into hands, act like you hurt something, stretch a little.""It slipped."
Ok let's slap everyones hands
If not for this man we wouldn't have seen Donkey lose in the finals last season. Air ball as you wish, King James.
Remember when he said he could shoot 90% from the line if he wanted? Yeah.... he's good, but shooting will never be a strength of his.
He can, he just airballed once in a career thing. Even MJ did once
Have you checked his career ft%? It's below 80%.
Yeah anything above 60 percent is good
League average is 76%
Well, at least he made that one free throw in game 7...that sealed the Warriors fate. I guess the GOAT can air ball a free throw now and again.
Lol stfu
Good, fuck LeCookie.
ahahahah, this dude mad

Are you referring to the Indians?
But did he blow a 3-1 lead in the finals?!
Lebron lost some sort of bet where he had to do this, I'm sure of it.
Lol at all the Lebron haters who crawled out of their holes to comment on this
Definitely not just LeBron haters.  I saw it live(I won't be silent) and thought it was hilarious.
Also airballed a shot at the rim and caught it for a travel.
I don't understand how LeBron is putting in more and more effort yet getting worse and worse at shooting.
LeBron for president ?
Dan Gilbert already tried.
Tragic Lebronson
Air balls tonight:Lebron ✅Curry ✅Gay ✅Draymond ✅Lillard ✅Noah ✅

Nothin' but net.
Watching Lebron James miss shots never gets old.
Just granny the damn ball.
Lebron is a good ft shooter, he just airballed once. Once in a career type of thing
Still though, have you seen the shot percent of the guys that do granny them?
It's a pretty small sample size
Bruh you're acting like he's Andre Drummond
Statistically it was bound to happen
It couldn't have been easy for his teammates to give him the obligatory high fives
I heard an interview with Rick Barry when he said his #1 problem with the NBA these days is when everyone high fives someone after a missed free throw.
the ~~Warriors~~ Indians blew a 3-1 lead in the Finals
Gotta love the commentary continuing on as though its nothing.
Its that 19 year old bone structure. He's still got some growing to do...
He seemed very little engaged Probably hung over from previous night party

Whenever Iebron shoots free throws they always seem to hit the rim a little short and kind flutter around. He's still the best player in the league.
ya hes never been a great free throw shooter. if he couldve been at ~80% for his career it wouldve meant a lot
that shit was real spooky.
And went to the Cubs game the same night.
*THE NUMBERS, JAMES. WHAT DO THEY MEAN?*
How do you get the video and make these clips? I want to do the same for you guys.
"Anthony Davis did what?"
The ref is even surprised
This is awesome and hilarious. The world's greatest player airballed a free throw. Even I haven't airballed a free throw and I suck.
if you throw up as many free throws as him, it's bound to happen!
Damn. This is some Space Jam shit. There is an alien in Lebron right now.
It's even more surprising that no player acknowledged or noticed that airball.
they definitely noticed, just didnt acknowledge it.
When your up 3-1 in a series and want to go to a game 7 #CleverIndians

Kind of looks like James harden says something to LeBron about itEdit, incomplete sentence
professional basketball shooter folks
It's game 7 of the NBA Finals, the Cavs are down 1 with 0.01 seconds to go in the 4th quarter. 22 yr old Lebron is at the line after recording an amazing 50 pt triple double and ready to send his team to OT. Lebron air balls the free throw... What would his career have been if this were to happen?
lol wut
Skip Bayless and LeBron haters are like:"HAHAHA finally, I haven't been able to really shit on LeBron for anything in particular in a while. Feels so good. He'll never be Jordan. He's a bum."
Nothing but net...The king is dead. Long live the king.
Lmao Lebron James responded to a bleachers report Instagram post saying that something was in his eye, atleast he is having a good laugh about it!
Nuttin' but net man!
Ray Allen didn't retire for this...
That's the drawback of having hooves.
Clearly it was because someone moved the ring
I have never understood the low 5 after free throws. Especially that one.
Superstition. Encouragement. Camaraderie.

As a guy who watches zero basketball (hate all you want) how often does this happen?
Happens to most players occasionally. Still fucking hilarious whenever it does though.
When the loudest thing in the arena is the clap after
And people say basketball isn't fixed lol!
Those high fives after lmao. He's tryna act like he ain't super tilted.
Hey, I can do that too!!! Look mom, I'm lebron!!!
is bending your knees not taught anymore??
What if this is an elaborate marketing scheme for the new space jam movie? Like he will progressively get worst so it would appear that the aliens have taken his talent and then when the movie comes out it will explain why he has been so bad and then BOOM he becomes a King again once he regains his talent back like in the movie.
Would also explain Joakim Noah's airball last night as well...
The King has never been great at free throws. Hes not DJ bad but I think his career % floats around 75%
DeAndre Jordan taught him well
Me playing NBA2K
Shaq gonna roast him but he is the king of free throw screw-ups
Yeah LBJs freethrows really let him down last night - was he not like 50% from the line?? I watched the game and just remember thinking 'damn son what's going on with your funky freethrowing!?' and when Rockets fouled Lebron with the ball at the end I was thinking 'shit he's at least going to miss 1 of 2'.
Did Jordan ever air a free-throw?
I mean...he did hit the net
Ahhhh the ol aggie swish
Cavs favored by 9, Bron air balls a free throw, cavs win by 8. Hmm.
I was there for this... the entire arena groaned. It was actually pretty funny looking back on it.
"swish" -lebron probly
This guy has the same timing as bill russell
The man doesn't want the scoring title to come too easily
Short!
Would be hilarious if he missed the net too
He looked off today and they still won.

considering they have a free road to the finals their chances are pretty good
"Jordan never did that... also, he never lost in the finals or let a finals series go 7".Stupid.
He also never played for a factory team
Literally 7 thumb scrolls down and someone pulls the MJ never did that... amazing.
I hate their announcers. That one guy that sounds like he just ate 5 big macs with a massive nacho as a side is annoying as fuck.
Lebrun's first appearance on Shaqtin' lmao. Had to happen eventually.
He's been on it before last year. I think it was a missed dunk.
it was when he just subbed himself and left 4 Cavs on the field.
If LeBron would've yelled 'In' instead of 'Short' it would've gone in.
LeBron nodded.

this is you guys' top 5 player of all-time? lmao
Bill Russell had FT55% and is considered one of the best...
Russell was a big man...Lebron is a wing player...
One single free throw in a 10+ year career is enough to influence where you would rank somebody? LOL ok
it doesn't, he never was in top 5.
He's a lock for top 5, if he retired tomorrow it would be consensus
that's why he is overrated.Pretty sure all the other "consensus" top 5 players all have at least 5 rings.  Lebron barely has 3 and people already want to put him there.  He could get someday, but not yet at least.
That isn't the only metric to judge a player by.
you're right, it's not the only metric.  But definitely one of the most important ones.
Yes, and taking it into consideration it's a super reach to keep lebron out of the top 5.
then what should be taking into consideration?stats? lol  stats are more difficult to compare than rings, because he plays in a weak conference all his career, also the style of the game is also much more different than many of the all-time great.  Obviously stats is a metric as well, but not nearly as important as rings imo.
The variable of which conference you play in is easier to account for than all the variables that go into winning a ring, notably how good your team is. Nobody wins on their own. Robert horry isn't on my top 10 list but he has a ton of rings.
The totality of someone's accomplishments, individual and team-wise (and stats are a part of that). And the consistency he's doing it with over his career only at just 31. His career at 31 is arguably just as good as any player in the history of the league at 31.
He's not in yours. But he's in most people. Deal with it. He's going to be #2 when he retires too.
My Halloween decorations next year will include "FT Air Ball" as one of the exhibits.
Channeling his inner Indians on that free throw ^feelsbadman
How on earth did the announcers not say anything??I know it's not a huge deal but they didn't even crack a joke or anything.
Don't worry, this is just part of the filming for Space Jam 2
Monstars took Lebron's powers? KD will likely join them voluntarily.  I don't like the TuneSquad's chances this time around.
Huge LeBron fan but your team should have points taken away for doing something as shit as this.
Did y'all not catch him shout "short"? At least he got a feel for his shot
I've done that before. I have something in common with Lebron.

Still worth as much as bouncing it out off the rim. Never understood why people build this up to be something so remarkable.
Skip Bayless just had a fun time.
i just wish some nba players would deny the 5 after a bad shot like that.
Lebron, Shaq, Ben Wallace and airball pioneer Chris Dudley - All current or former Cavs. Coincidence or Conspiracy?
His Hairless
I wonder if Jordan's ever airballed a FT......jus sayin'
As a Lebron hater, this makes my day
FreeThrow is really the worst part of LeBron's game.
His shooting in general from any distance where it's not a dunk or a lay-up is pretty wank
and the 3 point shot
3 pt shot is average. If he makes 1 out of 3, that is OK, that is like equal to 50% 2pt shot.But Free Throw is just bad, I almost have to expect he miss the first one, and then hit the second.  He had great free throw shoot games, but never can sustain it.
his 3 point shooting is similar, hes just a streaky shooter in general. unreliable and at times not confident in his shot at all. still the best of this generation though.
He has averaged above 40% for 3pt shooting for a season, but never above 80% for free throw.
ya and then shot 30% a few years later
I would be more impressed if LeBron can shoot above 85% FT for 1 season than he average triple double for 1 season.
His career 3pt % actually is better than Kobe's and MJ's.But his FT is almost 10% lower than Kobe and MJ.
He isn't a natural shooter. He makes up for it by being really well coordinated. He never has shot the ball in a really consistent way.
He put more effort in the hand slaps.
lebron had a halloween party taunting the warriors for choking a 3-1 leadthe indians just lost 2 games in a row with a 3-1 lead...forget the goat, lebron might be the new curse in cleveland

Shaq: Come on, man.Kenny: Come on, man.Charles: Come on, man.Ernie: Come on.
Looks skinny
bleacherreport had it on their instagram and lebron commented that he had something in his eye lol
It's okay he called short
He's really gotta work on his jumper if he's gonna put up a fight with father time
This should be the one time you don't get a high-five from the teamates.
He doesn't deserve high fives they should even be able to look at him after that
LeWe31nowandshitthatusedtobeeasyandnormalishardnow
He's high fiving hands before the ball even touches the floor.
Came here expecting LeDeAndre James jokes and see nothing of the sort. I am disappointed Reddit.
In my semi-pro days I have never done anything like that.But hey, I couldn't dunk either.
So what.
Coasting
I fuckin knew this dude was a bust.
To TOP
It is all because of that Warriors' pastry that he consumed
Love how biased ass Fred McLeod acted oblivious to LeBron's airball.
It's funny how the commentators don't even saying anything about it.
Jordan can make one with his eyes closed. Just saying
Ha ha they do the high five thing just like in the video games... When life imitates art, eh guys?
sounds like upvote party
Illuminati confirmed as producers for Space Jam 2.
How many air ball free throws did MJ have at 31?

Technically, if you're counting Finals MVP, Shaq qualifies for all of those.
and some people consider him the "greatest of all time" lol
You actually think this is an argument against that? Lmao
Of course not. Because there is no argument, he is not the greatest of all time.
jordan is my #1 for sure and lebron isnt even in second yet, but i think there can be an argument. theres an argument to be made for just about anything, nothing wrong with discussion
i'm all for lebron arguably being in the top 5 ever to play, but i'll take airballing free throws is a legitimate argument against that smdh
No it isnt
